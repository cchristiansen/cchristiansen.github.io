&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Øresund Øffensiv&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The heat hit first. Emanating from the mass of bodies, it clung to our
skin as we dithered along the aisle, looking for free seats in the
cinema-cum-sauna. We found two too near to the screen, draped clean towels over
the burgundy upholstery, sat down and shuffled out of our clothes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Good evening folks! Welcome to Ritz Cinemas and our first showing of &lt;i&gt;Nude
Tuesday&lt;/i&gt;! As some of you may have already gathered, this is a clothing-optional
showing. If this wasn’t communicated to you beforehand or you are feeling
uncomfortable, please do let me – or one of our helpers here this evening –
know. I’m sure we can get you to a screening of – I don’t know – &lt;i&gt;Top Gun&lt;/i&gt; or
something else instead. There will also be other clothing-mandatory times you
can catch this film too – don’t worry.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The MC continued to soothe and explain and clarify and take the edge off of the
jitteriness in the room. After some final words and applause,
the ads began to roll. We held each other’s hands, ecstatic with the novelty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The spoken gibberish is subtitled in English. The acting carries the
story; the subtitles buttress the laughter. A scene of a wife rejecting her
husband’s advances doubles its laughs once we read what her excuse is. When her
mother then gets nosy and tries to help with the situation, the comedy
comes from both the innuendo in gibberish, and its translation. A soaring
sonorous poem by the sex guru played by Jermaine Clement is later rendered
flacid and pathetic in English. The miscommunication, the subtitles, the
gibberish – it’s hilarious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The gibberish is faux-Scandi. Prior to filming, the Kiwi actors had listened
to Icelandic radio for two weeks straight, and attempted to not sound too
French, too Italian, too Greek. The choice of Nordic was astute, not only
because Northern Europeans are notoriously comfortable in the nude, but also
because the Nordic languages have a long history of miscommunication.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Norwegians, for example, cannot agree on how to write their language, and have
created &lt;i&gt;riksmål&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bokmål&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;nynorsk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;høgnorsk&lt;/i&gt; and many other shades of
&lt;i&gt;måls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;norsks&lt;/i&gt; inbetween. Another example is Cnut, King of Denmark
between 1018 and 1035, whose musings on the tide dumbfounded not only his
contemporaries but has also had historians, linguists and philosophers
scratching their heads for almost a millenium. (Ironically, Cnut’s grandfather
Harald Blåtand, King of Denmark c. 958 – c. 986, is the namesake of the
communications protocol Bluetooth.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The best example of Nordic confusion though stems from Norwegian television.
&lt;i&gt;Uti vår hage&lt;/i&gt;, a Norwegian show named after a Swedish folk song, filmed a
documentary of life in Denmark in 2003, revealing how Danes were no longer able
to communicate with one another in Danish. In the footage, a Dane attempts to
buy a new bike tyre, but ends up with a kamelåså instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me, the Danish language has collapsed into meaningless guttural sounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoter&quot;&gt;An unhappy customer, Episode 1, Uti vår
hage&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When the documentary first aired in Denmark, it was wrongly interpreted to be a
spoof and Swedes were wrongly identified to be the culprits. Danish protestors
lined the shore facing Sweden and launched sausages across the strait. Swedes
retaliated with meatballs. The ongoing Øresund Øffensiv remains to be
the major obstacle to Swedish ascession to NATO.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After the film and dressed again, my partner and I debriefed over a
fake-herring smörgåsbord and salmon smørresbrød at &lt;i&gt;Feilkommunikasjon&lt;/i&gt;.
‘Läcker,’ my partner grinned, savouring the lingonberry jam. ‘I really enjoyed
the film.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Me too,’ I agreed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘The choice of Nordic was particularly apt,’ she expounded, ‘given how
prevalent miscommunication in that region is. Take, for example, the Öresund
Öffensiv, where the Swedes started throwing pannbiff at the Danes. The
Danes retaliated with frikadellen. It all started with a Finnish TV
documentary…’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Wasn’t it…’ I butt in, but she is having none of it. I stand my ground.
She retaliates, so I throw salmon and she throws herring and covers me in
lingonberry jam but wham what a shot but oh no her towel and we shout at one
another across straits descending into meaningless guttural sounds, gibbering
away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I look at us both, ryebreaded and leverpostejed, and ask, ‘What are we fighting
about again?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
She blinks and looks at me. ‘I don’t know – it’s all Greek to me.’
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new pet</title>

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;A new pet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Isabella, popular Isabella, got one first. Her aunt in the Alps had gifted it
to her, after a trip to see the spring blossom. ‘I’m sorry about your hamster,’
she had said, ‘I’m sure it can never be replaced,’ she had continued, ‘but here
is a new… all the way from Japan… it’s like a pet, and you’ll have to take care
of
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Gerbil’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘I’m sorry?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘It was my gerbil. Jeremiah.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Well here’s a &lt;i&gt;tomogochee&lt;/i&gt;​… all the way from Japan…’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And we crowded around Isabella when she first brought it to the playground.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘What is it?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Is it a Digimon?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Does it speak?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Does it fart?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Isabella held her chin high, above the sniggers, and slowly bestowed her
snippets of wisdom. She prodded the new thing and the new thing squeaked. We
squealed with excitement, and envy. ‘It’s a &lt;i&gt;tomato-chee&lt;/i&gt;,’ she explained, ‘and
it doesn’t fart. It poos.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next day, Hannah had one. The Monday after, James, Miriam, Luke, Megan,
Other James, Olly, Meg 2, Leela and Chloe also had one. Soon, everybody else
had stopped kicking a ball about or skipping or gossipping, they were all
caring for their new pets. After bargaining with Meg 2 and promising her I
wouldn’t ever tell anybody that – ah, you almost got me – I got one too. It was
pink, it had three buttons, it was a bit scuffed on the left side, and it was
mine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I cradled the blobular avatar, I watched its mouth open and close, I pressed
the three buttons and gawped unknowingly at the undecipherable symbols floating
on screen. I was happy. Two days later, it was dead.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;org086e1cf&quot; class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./a-new-pet.webp&quot; alt=&quot;a-new-pet.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays, I have multiple Tamagotchis and have learnt their languages of beeps
and symbols. I nurture them and nurse them; I keep them alive. At home, I have
two big Tamagotchis who are fairly low maintenance: they need occasional
updating, a few parts replacing, an occasional scrub. Nothing much. I’ve given
sufficient vaccinations to one so that it no longer requires antivirus. My
housemates and I fawn over the other one. Most evenings we prepare our dinners
and eat our food sitting on the sofa in its glowing presence for hours on end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A smaller Tamagotchi lives in my pocket and sleeps under my pillow. It purrs
and buzzes, flashes and blinks. I tend to it fifty times a day: checking its
status, keeping it topped up, silencing it when it all becomes too much. But
it’s my newest Tamagotchi I’m most excited about. It’s strapped to my wrist and
knows all about me. I’m outside playing football, it deduces. My heart is
beating at 132 beats per minute, it informs me. I’ve walked more than the
target it’s set for me, it congratulates me. Low battery, it lets me know.
Please charge me, it demands. I stop with the ball and stare at the back of my
wrist. Charge me, it demands. I stare. Charge. Me. I unstrap the Tamagotchi. I
feel its metal weight. I hold it in my hands, and I watch it die.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>That time of the year</title>
        <link>https://christianchristiansen.net/log/that-time-of-the-year.html</link>

        <description>
        
&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;That time of the year&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The signs had been there. The red and green beach balls. The notices from HR.
The upcoming events. The planning, the organisation, the planning the
organisation. My local magpie had told me the other day that the eastern koels
were back, yapping on about their time spent in Queensland – it couldn’t wait
for the koels to go back, if they thought it was so bloody good there. Or
that’s what I imagined the magpie saying, as it squawked in my face on the
balcony causing me to spill my morning eggnog.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It had been coming. This time I was more prepared. I had done the shopping, the
careful filtering out of anything too tacky, too lavish, too unfair, too pink,
too blue, too heavy, too cheap, too expensive, too immoral, too moral, too
passé – a yo-yo and Tamagotchi just don’t cut it anymore. I had done the
shopping, bought appropiately themed wrapping paper, felt both guilty and
proud of the resulting packages, and shipped off the goodies with (hopefully)
ample time. Then there were more trips to the post office to pick up gifts
with cards from faraway relatives and well-wishers. The cards vie with
the flowers for space on top of the piano; the gifts nestle beneath a tree
comprised primarily of cardboard, green felt-tip pen marks and good intentions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But it arrived today. &lt;i&gt;Oops, I did it again&lt;/i&gt; was my most listened to track of
the year, a music streaming service informs me. These were the films I should
have watched, a columnist lets me know. I open a little door to reveal
a drawing of a festive animal in festive attire. I eat a square of chocolate. I
race other programmers to solve a puzzle about calorie-counting elves. Joy to
the world. The silly season is here.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A review of A Collection of Reviews</title>

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;A review of A Collection of Reviews&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had finished sipping my orange green tea and set off back to the station,
when a blockade in the pavement of books for 5 dollars stopped me. The Agatha
Christie’s reeled me in, but my nose led me away, into the shop. Suddenly, I
was confronted by vast stacks of porcelain knick-knacks, sculpted felines
serving as bowls, pots and other vessels to hold pumpkin soup and sour cream on
a pleasant Georgian recreational summer’s day. I froze. Luckily, I spotted a
sign by some steps to the basement promising books.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I descended the stairs, my eyes feasted upon lines upon lines of the goods.
A motley assortment of texts sliced the room into partitions; each partition
fielded a powerful possé of mouthpieces for its allotted subject: Australian
history, experimental French literature, gardening and garden allotments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I finally reached the literary criticism section, searching for &lt;i&gt;The
Over-Abundance of Unnecessary Literary Examples Within Literature&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Get To
The Point&lt;/i&gt;, I spotted a white tome: &lt;i&gt;A Collection of Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; by Andrea
C. Hansdatter. The collection didn’t have a price, and the shopkeeper appeared
to be baffled by its presence, so I offered to relieve her of her bafflement
and book for 5 bucks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It has been consuming me ever since. The collection appears to order the books
first by author surname, and then by publication date. However this system is
already abandoned at Atwood, where Hansdatter proceeds to review Orwell,
Huxley, Zamyatin, More and a slew of other dystopian/utopian fiction. Indeed,
in the review of &lt;i&gt;A Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt;, a commentary about the novelty of seeing
a dystopia from predominantly an individual’s perspective as opposed to from a
greater societal view, is sidelined by a vehement critique, in which Hansdatter
chastises &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; for pillaging &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; of its plot and characters, and eschewing
the radical innovative narrative language and changing the power dynamic of the
central couple to the detriment of the woman. Hansdatter lambasts Orwell’s
other work too, though I suspect she has not read them (aside from perhaps
&lt;i&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/i&gt;); this is based off of a hunch, however, as I have not read them
yet either.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The reviews vary greatly in style, length, comprehensability, accuracy and
taste, much like the books reviewed. However, common threads do shine through.
Hansdatter often begins with some background on how she came across the book.
She’s forever travelling from one place to another, sampling exotic
delicatessen, being barraged by sudden apparitions of &lt;i&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/i&gt;
compilations. Infuriatingly, we never find out why her baguette is red, nor
what her destination is; her train of thought is always interrupted by a review
of a book.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Certain frames of reference pop up consistently too. Although Hansdatter is not
as profligate as say Quentin Tarantino or Mark Fisher in plucking esoteric
references from Japanese action films or Japanese cyberpunk anime, she will
happily name-drop Tarantino and Fisher, without introduction, to make a point
clear. She is particularly fond of using examples from her personal life,
Hans C. Andersen’s stories, and quips from an imaginary friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pithy, short, cutting statements dot Hansdatter’s collection. The entry for
&lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;/i&gt; states: ‘Eat forty seven heaped spoonfuls of sugar to
achieve a similar effect.’ On &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt;, she writes:
‘Orcs and destiny are rather dull.’ The shortest review I have found so far, is
the entry for &lt;i&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/i&gt;: ‘The best.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Through her shifts in tone, her references, her favourites, her digressions, we
gradually piece together parts of Hansdatter’s personality, and the world she
inhabits. We learn of her love of Greece, and how on her first trip there she
saw ‘the perfect marriage of sea, land and sky; resplendent majesty to be
savoured whole’. We learn that she adores swimming outside, whether in a port
in Copenhagen, where she can smell the cinnamon buns crispening in the morning
winter sun; in a glacial lake in the Alps with her best friend, splashing in
the deep turquoise; or at Little Bay beach after a day painting the restless
seascape, musing on the words of the artist Maggi Hambling:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sea – I suppose it is a metaphor for life and death, and recycling and all
of that. It is also very sexy. I mean, you see a distant wave gradually
fumbling about. Approaching, approaching, approaching, until it reaches the
shore. It is pretty orgasmic, when it crashes, when it dissolves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We do not learn who her favourite artist is, nor which piece of artwork she
holds dearest; but Hansdatter self-knowlingly and pain-stakingly describes
&lt;i&gt;Zeichenreihen&lt;/i&gt;, a painting by Vasily Kandinsky, in which Kandinsky lines up
all of his favourite motifs on shelves, proudly on display to his audience.
Like Kandinsky’s &lt;i&gt;Zeichenreiehn&lt;/i&gt;, Hansdatter’s reviews are full of her
favourite motifs, all lined up, stark, colourful, sharpened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We are treated to a plethora of these motifs in perhaps Hansdatter’s longest
review, her review of &lt;i&gt;Die Lebenden und die Toten&lt;/i&gt;, a crime story in German by
Nele Neuhaus. In the review, Hansdatter intersects a complete line-by-line
English translation with swathes of venom. Here is a taster:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a characterless characterisation of a character without character. The
language is bland. The character is bland. It leaves me salivating for dry bark
instead, splinters included.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“She has been an Executive Partner at an international consultancy for eight
years, responsible for the restructuring and internationalisation of companies,
and two years ago she was assigned as the head of Management Consulting.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lack of detail is conspicuous. Which international consultancy? For what
companies? Are there any positions and departments more vague than Executive
Partner and Management Consulting? Where’s the bark?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hansdatter also includes a full translation of Franz Kafka’s &lt;i&gt;The
Metamorphosis&lt;/i&gt;. All previous translations of ‘ungeheurer Ungeziefer’ into
English did not quite sit right with her; she deemed them all to be ‘repulsive
monstrosities’. So she translated the phrase, then the first sentence, and then
simply continued until she had translated the whole novella. In my view,
Hansdatter’s translation is sublime, as sublime as any I can imagine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whether these two are her only reviews to include full original translations, I
do not know. There is no contents page, and the index appears to have
been plagiarised word for word from the index of &lt;i&gt;Index, A History of the&lt;/i&gt;. The
only reliable method to find a review of a specific book within the collection
is to flick through and spot its italicised name.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And that is driving me mad. The longer I read &lt;i&gt;A Collection of Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;,
the more convinced I am that Hansdatter is furiously editing it as I read it. I
had thought that Hansdatter had neglected to mention &lt;i&gt;La Disparation&lt;/i&gt;, but when
I check it now, it is right there, in its correct alphabetical place. And the
review for &lt;i&gt;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&lt;/i&gt; has gained wings and vanished into the
very air. To catch the text shape-shifting, I have purchased a scanner. To my
dismay, when I lay any page from the collection against the glass screen, the
scanner registers only blank page after blank page. But only for this one book;
it photocopies the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, passports and
currency fine, but those are of no use to me. To outsmart my book-bothering
trickster, I have started to keep the collection on my person at all times; I
sleep with the book beneath my pillow. This has brought about another issue:
stories I dream of during the night now appear reviewed in the book the day
after. Even for stories which are simply a figment of my imagination. I swear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am overcome with a sense of futility. How am I to review this book of
reviews, which expands as I sleep? Who am I to review this book of
reviews, to judge Hansdatter? Who am I to review a review of a book if
I have not read the book reviewed? Can I even have a valid opinion, if I have
never read Tolstoy and Joyce, &lt;i&gt;Hamlet&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Somewhere within the collection, Hansdatter forgets which book she is
reviewing, and wonders:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why do I bother? However many books I read, it will be but a drop in the ocean.
What am I trying to do? Am I simply trying to add feathers to my tail, to
peacock around and attract a bespectacled mate, to prove my worth to some
unthinking reader or unknowing deity? I try to surf these waves of prose and
poetry to gaze at the heavens, to grasp at grounds for my existence, to not be
dragged down by the crashing rips which course over me; questions tear me
from every dimension. I grasp onto books, other humans’ defiant claims to
relevancy after death; I allow their ideas, preserved from cranium to ink, to
dance released again in my mind. I hope to glean another way, another path,
to understand this maelstrom of being, to see the world anew, again and ever
again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reading Hansdatter’s worries comforts me; another creature wrestles the same
demons. And rightfully so, I might add, for I have spotted a glaring hole in &lt;i&gt;A
Collection of Reviews&lt;/i&gt;. Despite her professed admiration of him, Andrea C.
Hansdatter has neglected to review any of Hans C. Andersen’s works. However,
Andrea C. Hansdatter has, inexplicably, somehow written a one sentence review
of &lt;i&gt;A review of A Collection of Reviews&lt;/i&gt; by C. C.:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C. C., evidently, should have picked up an Agatha Christie instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Back for a holiday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A particular patriotic pride presided the passage to the pissoir. Upright men
of all ages stood tall in an orderly British queue. We filed in, awaited our
turn, and – as our forefathers had done in the Boer – carried out God’s duty,
before we filed back to refill and rearm ourselves for another round.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ahead of me, two young gents shuffled along, bravely directing their attention
away from nature’s calling, aided by those smartphone devices. Their lit-up
faces the very picture of sangfroid, or was it ennui? A urinal became free, and
the first chap marched forth. The second pleaded to join in, as he was
‘bursting’. I am no socialist, but when I see a Brit extend favour to his
fellow countryman – as any good Anglican would – I well up. ‘God Save the
King!’ remarked I in admiration, slapping the pair of them, rugger style.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another compatriot had become peckish during his journey from watering hole to
water closet. ‘I’ll have my cake and eat it’, the blonde mopped patron
proclaimed, before reaching in to sample the goods. He crunched and grinned,
beaming at his captive audience, foaming between his teeth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At last, my time had come. I proceeded, planted my two feet, and produced one
proud prick. Gushing with relief and bonhomie, I parleyed with my good
neighbour. ‘God bless you sir,’ greeted I. A steely glance was my reply.
Touché, nodded I in return. We are but men of few words. My salutation parried
and my business finished, I caught myself in the zip.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘God’s sake,’ muttered my son. ‘Again, Papa?’ he had said after I relayed my
story to him. ‘You know,’ he continued, ‘I think it’s time you moved back. You
haven’t been the same ever since you moved to Malaga.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Wonderful world&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The days were becoming shorter. Summer had been kind to us. Travelling from
loch to loch, broch to broch, Stewart and I spent sunrise to sunset soaking in
the Scottish sun, savouring the sharp contours of the landscape, the briskness,
the too real beauty surrounding us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Brenda Lee sang through our stereo, as we
drove along the long, lonesome roads. It was just the two of us, the vast
sublime vistas, and the sweet sonorous Fifties and Sixties. Stewart would
repeatedly ask for The Bobbettes and I would put on &lt;i&gt;Mr Lee&lt;/i&gt;. His fat chubby
face would crinkle with joy and sing along with such glee. How I would flutter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On our walks I told childhood tales of walking across the moor and finding the
perfect song to match the hike, to match my emotions. Stewart would then recall
old comedy routines about Braveheart, about shortbread, offal and heroin.
Occasionally his brow would furrow with a quizzical look.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There was a joke he was working on, about the Loch Ness monster. About
conspiracy theories and mistrust of experts. About how despite not having the
requisite knowledge in the relevant subjects, people jumped to such
strongly-held beliefs. But he couldn’t work out the structure, the form. A joke
is delicate, like a song, he explained once. The tiniest bit of inspiration
might be all that it takes. A breeze then blew the lines from his face and he
smiled at me again, and resumed telling me about the local history, the myths
and the Auld Alliance between the Scots and the French.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… the French I took
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I do know that I love you &lt;br /&gt;
And I know that if you loved me, too &lt;br /&gt;
What a wonderful world this would be
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sam Cooke’s lyrics washed over me as I watched Stewart delight in recalling
treaty details. I’ll show the song to him, I decided. That’s how I’ll let him
know. How I feel. What a wonderful world this would be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Our final stop was Loch Ness. Summer had been kind to us. We sat by the shore,
a few puffy clouds in an ever bluer sky our only companions. I prepared, and
looked Stewart in the eye. My heart whined.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Stew? I would like to play a song for you.’ I held out an earpiece. His hand
brushed against mine as he placed his earpiece into his ear, and I placed mine
into mine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&#x27;t know much about history &lt;br /&gt;
Don&#x27;t know much biology &lt;br /&gt;
Don&#x27;t know much about a science book &lt;br /&gt;
Don&#x27;t know much about the French I took
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I do know that…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Yes, YES!’ he leaped.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘I’ve got the joke!’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Harry Potter and The Master and Margarita&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
‘Are you feeling litigious?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
J. K. reponds with an empty smile. She brushes a loose strand of hair behind
her ear, and looks back out of the carriage window, staring into the space
between the pane and the Scottish fields sliding past. The dull scenery dances
through droplets which clutch onto the exterior for a while, before drifting
diagonally out of our vision.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘I feel litigious,’ butts in a broad voice. ‘Lawyer me up. When I go around
anywhere, I see copycats everywhere. I want barristers spilling out of my
holsters. I’m sick of seeing myself in this infernal fun house of mirrors. I’ll
sue them all, to hell and back. I’m the original fat cat. Humour me please, at
the very least: create a more trim version of me. Behind a couple of pounds of
this baby pudge, lies a rather cute pussy.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The behemoth of a cat across the aisle from J. K. and me pokes at its monstrous
belly, which bulges with such a gusto, unseen dimensions wobble to contain its
bulk. Sat facing the cat, is a mad-hatted man (well, who wears a fez these
days?) and betwixt this odd pair a chess game is in play.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The cat’s companion, the fez fellow, twists his long face towards J. K. and me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Comrades, please, excuse my friend. Behemoth here, he can be …’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fez bloke’s voice blurs into the background, as I become wholly absorbed by
the kittification of nightmare. Surely the cat didn’t just talk? Now, it (he?)
appears to be taking advantage of the fez man’s ongoing apology to J. K. and me
by furtively winking, twitching his (its?) whiskers and sticking his(?) tongue
out at his opponent’s pieces. One of the fez chap’s knight pieces deciphers
this unorthodox semaphoric display and assents; the souped-up tiny jockey
canters off the board and enjoys some well-deserved rest. The retired knight is
reportedly glad for a chance to stop horsing around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘… rather prone to bouts of outbursts (and idioms). Apologies, again, comrades.
Good day.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Call me a sack full of proverbs if you must, but I will not be restrained.
Till the cows come home, I will remain bullish. My tongue is as free as a bird,
like a bat out of hell; it flies like a butterfly and stings like a bee; as it
laps up milk and honey, it too will flap into battle, and slap slap slappity
slap any foe foe pho-munching foe. I’ll have it you, you twits.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Behemoth, please, stop it now. There’s no need for this palaver. Let’s leave
our comrades in peace and return to our game.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A miffed Behemoth, and the fezmeister, settle back down over the chessboard.
Confusion slowly spreads across the hatted man’s brow, as he inspects the
empty square where he could swear one of his knights should be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I collect myself, and resolve not to look to my left again. &lt;i&gt;I’ll just pretend
they’re not there.&lt;/i&gt; J. K., opposite me, appears to be of the same mind. She is
desperately trying to distract herself by scribbling into a thin notepad. Below
a reminder to watch Star Wars again, and a line which reads &lt;i&gt;have the Defence
Against the Dark Arts teachers last as long as Spinal Tap drummers&lt;/i&gt;, I spot the
words &lt;i&gt;include living chess pieces like the crazy cat’s&lt;/i&gt; being added.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Are you feeling litigious?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tic-like, the question slips from my mouth again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Why?’ J. K. bites this time, covering her writing, annoyed, as if I have
asked some outrageous favour from her, as if I have asked whether I may tickle
her behind the knees, on a Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Well, I’ve been pondering a bit recently, about your work, and about
influences generally, really, and I, I couldn’t help but… well, you see, we
all… to be influenced is to be human, right? Ideas don’t just zoom into… out
of the blue…’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Ooh, look! Look! Fezzy fezster, check this out! Out the window!’ The cat has
lept onto his hind legs and is jumping up and down on his poor seat, jabbing a
paw at a… outside in the rain… a car? No. A flying car. ‘She’s coming to the
party! Woohoo!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Yoohoo! Margarita! Margarita!’ he continues to holler, waving his frying
pan-sized paw at the flying Ford Rossiya E501 Deluxe. From inside the
airborne vehicle, the so-hollered Margarita gives Behemoth two thumbs up,
beaming under her crooked hat. ‘I’ll see you at Woland(emort)’s,’ we read from
her lips.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Ah, the new witch learns quick,’ booms the hat man. ‘Brooms are terribly
inconvenient, even the silk-padded ones. Cars are far superior. Back support is
not to be underestimated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘And it is far too easy, awfully easy, to lose one’s headgear when
riding a broom. I have lost a plethora of fedoras, an array of berets; it is
how I have ended with this one, you see, the fez, to match my prince-nez.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Automobiles, are they not just wonderful? I do enjoy a good train ride though,
comrades, it must be said. The characters you meet on a locomotive, they can be
truly remarkable.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Behemoth was too animated to notice his friend’s soliloquy. ‘I can’t wait for
Woland(emort)’s! The party will be the bee’s knees, the cat’s whiskers, the
dog’s …’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘J. K., what I really mean is…,’ I struggle to tear my attention away from the
ongoing farce to my left. It has all gotten rather out of hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘What I mean is…,’ I plough on. ‘When does inspiration become plagiarism? Can
an idea be borrowed, or copied, or stolen? What are the differences? When is a
tip of a hat, more than that?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘And what the devil does that have to do with whether I’m feeling litigious or
not?’ J. K. bats back icily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Don’t misunderstand me, please, but I’m thinking of writing a piece… I
recently read The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov and I couldn’t help
but notice some similarities between Bulgakov’s book and your own wizard ones…’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘What are you going to do? Write: “Three things occur in both Harry Potter and
The Master and Margarita:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;org-ol&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;living chess pieces;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;flying cars;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;travel by fireplace.”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don’t need my permission for that. Anybody can do that. However, I confirm
and deny nothing.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Well no… that’s not quite what I plan to do; bullet points would be a tad
bland. Also, I will have to mention somewhere (shoehorn if necessary) that The
Master and Margarita is Daniel Radcliffe’s favourite book. It’s too juicy a
fact to leave out. What I’m thinking of is possibly…’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘What? Fictionalising me?’ she ponders, sucking against her teeth. A few tense
beats hang before she shrugs. ‘Hell, whatever. I’m a reasonable human being
with reasonable views. Do whatever you want,’ returning to twirling her Biro
and messing about with Professor (Lord) Woland(emort)’s name.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Relief and exhaustion seep through my body. A shudder… slides. I
focus on my breathing for some time. The pitter patter of rain has eased, and
the countryside outside is now English. The night has sidled up, with a cold
blanket, asking softly how my day has been. I try to look at my watch, to see
how long left of the journey there is, but my eyelids are too heavy. Gradually,
my ears are drawn, yet again, despite my earnest resolution, back to the
peculiar couple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Oi, Fezzer, remind me again. How are the rest of the gang getting to
Woland(emort)’s tonight?’ purrs Behemoth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Why? Have you not seen the chimney renovations? Surely you must be able to
figure it out by now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Wellness Productivity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While following the scent of some sparkly stones, I have become trapped by
wall-high posters, shiny DVD cases; cursive, serif and sans-serif types
string me to an unseen ball and chain, dangling my prospects afore a row of
bared lips, which strain to contain the overflowing bleached whites within. One
by one the infinite smiles approach me. A clean bugle call precedes each
hovering mouth, ‘Please give a [Most Well And Distinguished Welcome] to our
[Honorable And High Distinguished Knowledger] on the [Affairs Of Life Of Humans
And Similar],’ joined in chorus by ethereal recommendations stemming from
unlocatable institutes and growth centres.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘If only I had heard from [] earlier, I may have never have had any issues with
my organic coffee cupholder.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘[] lays bare the secrets of the universe and more, and strips back the veil
from nature and beyond, and denudes the mist from everything itself and etc.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘I have bought multiple copies of []’s [], in order to digest the insights not
only aurally and visually, but nasally too. Listen, read and snort yourself to
enlightenment. Bless you.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The oncoming grin is accompanied by some other feature: a loose-fitting shirt,
a size-too-small skirt, a tie with both stripes and dots on of course to
indicate personality. Floating above sit the two same, dead eyes, boring into
my self-worth, mining me for nuggets to melt and fashion into a bangle, a nose
piercing, a monogrammed button, to adorn my latest life guide.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Good Life, Dear Listener/Reader/Other Consumption Methoder. I am
Professor/Most Distinguished/Reviled By None/Envy Of The Mongeese
Smithy/Dharma/Valhallalala, Student/Learner of the Path/Road/Seaway to The
End/Wisdom/Valhallalala. I bring you gifts of Gold Standard Lessons in
Self/Unself/All-selves/Only-elves Respect and myrrh. I will Teach How to
Approach Your Journey, and Baby, You have just Started.’ A gush of canned
uplift muzak plays, and the learnings commence. Different smiles espouse
different aphorisms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Give me a Buddha, and I will give you a quote.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘The way to Live Laugh Love, is to Shift Shaft Shove.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘I am the walrus, goo-goo g’joob, g’goo goo g’joob, goo goo g’joob [copyright,
the Beatles].’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But every philosophy comes coated with the same layers upon layers of
justification. Not only do ceaseless recommendations riddle the
poster/book/DVD/other medium at hand, but validation from
history/tradition/science/religion (but only The Bible, Greek mythology and
Buddhism, maybe a sprinkling of Tao, and a quote from Gandhi of course) is also
hauled out, to tenuously brace the argument that there are 109 Methods to
Betterment Wellness Productivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I splutter. The fumes of mouthwash emanating from the parade of incisors brews
with smothering incense and the hanging musk of a spiritual gathering in my
nostrils; my body shuts. ‘Help!’ I shout. ‘Help me!’ More and more mouths spout
advice, more and more quirkily patterned cravats press forward to prescribe me
their experiences. Self-help books eagerly flap and wink their pages at me,
podcasters and influencers cast their lashes towards me. ‘Help me. Help,’ I
whimper. A friend answers. ‘What’s up buddy? Talk to me.’ And I do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Heard whilst hyperventilating on Fiddlesticks, Organ Pipes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Christian. Christian? Can you hear me? Christian… you’re safe. We’ve got you on
rope. Christian, talk to us. It’s all good. We’ve got you. Yes, yes. It’s
incredibly chossy. You don’t need to worry about us. We’re safe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can do it. Keep going. Use those chimney skills. You can dangle the bag
between your legs, if you want to. Just keep moving. Christian. Christian?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, keep going. We’ve got you. Nic’s got you. Good work! Pull on those cams.
What’s that? There’s no more aid? Keep going. You can do it. What about the
foot to the left?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Breathe, Christian, breathe. Christian, talk to us. Yes, it’s chossy. You’re
safe. Good work with the cam. You can leave the nuts in. You’re taking them
out? Good work. You can do it. Keep moving. Come on Christian.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It’s still chossy? Don’t worry Christian. You’re doing well. Just keep moving.
Nice work. Really good work. Come on. Keep going. Breathe. Remember to breathe.
Nice work with the cam. Come on Christian, keep going. You can do it. Keep
moving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It’s a bit of a squeeze. It’s nicer rock there? Nice. Keep going. You’re doing
really well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fantastic work Christian. You’re almost there. Nice work. Keep going. That’s
fantastic. Really good work. Keep going. You’re almost there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nice work! Enjoy the view. Really really well done! Right, can one of you check
my knot?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What, Christian? No. No, that doesn’t count as a fucking ice cream.

&lt;p&gt;
By pitting ourselves against opponents and frequently failing, we develop an
understanding of our shortcomings, our prejudices, our inexhaustible capacity
to flop. Games provide safe padded spaces to fall flat on our faces, while
still yielding a sense of accomplishment when we stand firm.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, folk are fallible, and friends fickle. To hone our skills at any hour,
against an opponent who will never tire, we have to create a computer ersatz,
an algorithmic adversary, to face our ire. Gather around the kiln, watch and
learn, and see how we forge an indefatigable undefeatable foe from pure
thought-stuff and (metaphorical) fire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Noughts and crosses, also inexplicably called tic-tac-toe by Yanks, is a game
in which two players alternately place noughts and crosses on a three-by-three
grid; the winner is the first player to place three of their symbol in a
straight line: horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Consult the relevant Wikipeda article and its citations for more information on
noughts and crosses than you could ever want.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-programming-language&quot;&gt;The programming language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-the-programming-language&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Python is the de facto programming language for learning, teaching and
artificial intelligence (amongst many other fields). For the scope of this
tutorial, the use of any other programming language would be a gratuitous
affectation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The best books on Python are &lt;i&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/i&gt; by Luciano Ramalho and &lt;i&gt;Effective
Python&lt;/i&gt; by Brett Slatkin. For beginners, there are copious stellar resources
available; any search engine is your friend. The Pythonic idioms to be
aware of here, are list comprehension and dunders. More generally, within
this tutorial, the most difficult programming paradigms used are &lt;i&gt;recursion&lt;/i&gt;
and &lt;i&gt;currying&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;The Little Schemer&lt;/i&gt; by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias
Felleisen is an excellent primer on both of these concepts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-the-program&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-program&quot;&gt;The program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-the-program&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The opponent exhaustively considers every possible move, and determines which
move has the lowest chance of leading to a loss. Many aspects of the program
leave much to be desired. However, the primary purpose of this tutorial is to
demonstrate how to create a simple, non-optimised, artificially intelligent
opponent, and not to win a beauty pageant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data
structures and their relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/193245/&quot;&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We represent an empty starting board as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;board = &quot; &quot;*9
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where a space denotes an empty cell, &lt;code&gt;&quot;0&quot;&lt;/code&gt; a nought and &lt;code&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/code&gt; a cross. Players
are represented as &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; for noughts and &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; for crosses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We define which indices represent each row, column and diagonal. Remember that
Python begins indexing at 0, not 1, as Dijkstra ordained.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def rowx(x):
    return [3*x, 3*x+1, 3*x+2]

def coly(y):
    return [0+y, 3+y, 6+y]

diagdown = [0, 4, 8]
diagup = [2, 4, 6]
rows = [rowx(i) for i in range(3)]
cols = [coly(i) for i in range(3)]
diags = [diagdown, diagup]
all_directions = rows + cols + diags
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To return a list of cells which are still empty:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def possible(board):
    return [i for i, x in enumerate(board) if x == &quot; &quot;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we insist that noughts always starts first (it is called noughts and crosses
for a reason), we can determine whose turn it is by counting how many cells are
still empty. One great consequence of programming our own game, is being
beholden to our own prejudices and setting our own idiosyncratic rules. &lt;i&gt;Note:&lt;/i&gt;
noughts is denoted by &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, crosses by &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def player(board):
    return (board.count(&quot; &quot;)-1) % 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Knowing the player allows us to figure out what the board looks like after a
move. &lt;i&gt;Note:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;int(True) = 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int(False) = 0&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def new_board(board, move):
    return board[:move] + str(int(player(board))) + board[move+1:]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The following allows us to find out if the game has finished, and if so, who
the winner is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def moves_left(board):
    return board.count(&quot; &quot;)

def winner(board):
    if moves_left(board) &amp;lt; 5:
        for direction in all_directions:
            try:
                if sum(int(board[i]) for i in direction) == 3:
                    return &quot;X&quot;
                if sum(int(board[i]) for i in direction) == 0:
                    return &quot;O&quot;
            except ValueError:
                continue
        if moves_left(board) == 0:
            return &quot;nobody&quot;
    return False
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-icky-inputs-and-outlandish-outputs&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;icky-inputs-and-outlandish-outputs&quot;&gt;Icky inputs and outlandish outputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-icky-inputs-and-outlandish-outputs&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Humans are visual creatures. Even for geeks with no more than an ASCII console,
a 9 character long string does not suffice as a representation for a board. We
must make at least some minimal pretension to aesthetic nous.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def display_possible(board):
    return &quot;, &quot;.join(str(x) for x in possible(board))

def display_player(p):
    return &quot;X&quot; if p else &quot;O&quot;

def display_cell(x):
    if x == &quot;1&quot;:
        return &quot;X&quot;
    if x == &quot;0&quot;:
        return &quot;O&quot;
    return x

def display(board):
    print()
    print(
        &quot;\n_ _ _\n&quot;.join(
            &quot;|&quot;.join(display_cell(board[3*x+y]) for y in range(3))
            for x in range(3)
        )
    )
    print()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Humans are not only visual creatures, but also butter-fingered. Use exceptions
to limit the damage a human can do when they mash the keyboard. &lt;code&gt;while True&lt;/code&gt;
loops forever, providing ample time for the not-so-fleet-footed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def get_human_player():
    while True:
        x = input(&quot;Would you like to be noughts O or crosses X?: &quot;)
        return True if x.lower() == &quot;x&quot; else False

def human_move(board):
    while True:
        try:
            move = input(f&quot;Choose a move from {display_possible(board)}: &quot;)
            if int(move) in possible(board):
                return new_board(board, int(move))
            print(&quot;That number was not valid, please choose another.&quot;)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            print(&quot;Please input a number, not a string.&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-forging-the-foe&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;forging-the-foe&quot;&gt;Forging the foe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-forging-the-foe&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The algorithm we implement for the computer is called minimax. Namely, the
computer chooses the move which maximises its chances that its opponent will
have minimal chances to win. To calculate the score, minimax recursively calls
itself exhaustively until all potential scenarios have been considered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def score(result):
    if result == &quot;O&quot;:
        return 1
    if result == &quot;X&quot;:
        return -1
    return 0

def maxmin(x, maximise):
    return max(x) if maximise else min(x)

def minimax(board, maximise=True):
    if result:=winner(board):
        return score(result)
    return maxmin(
        [
            minimax(new_board(board, move), not maximise)
            for move in possible(board)
        ],
        maximise
    )

def computer_best_move(board):
    best_minimax_score = None
    best_move = None
    for move in possible(board):
        minimax_score = minimax(new_board(board, move), maximise=player(board))
        if (
                best_move is None or
                (player(board) and minimax_score &amp;lt; best_minimax_score) or
                (not player(board) and minimax_score &amp;gt; best_minimax_score)
        ):
            best_minimax_score = minimax_score
            best_move = move
    return best_move

def computer_move(board):
    move = computer_best_move(board)
    return new_board(board, move)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-wrap-up&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-wrap-up&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We then put the pieces together to create a playable game. The &lt;code&gt;EOFError&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;KeyboardInterrupt&lt;/code&gt; allow the human player to exit at any time. The dunders
in &lt;code&gt;__name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;&lt;/code&gt; are daft, but alas, all languages have their
defects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;def main(human=False):
    try:
        board = &quot; &quot;*9
        while not winner(board):
            display(board)
            if player(board) == human:
                board = human_move(board)
            else:
                board = computer_move(board)
        display(board)
        print(f&quot;Finished! Winner is {winner(board)}&quot;)
    except (EOFError, KeyboardInterrupt):
        print(&quot;\nAbort\n&quot;)
        exit()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    HUMAN = get_human_player()
    main(human=HUMAN)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The complete code is available &lt;a href=&quot;./noughts-and-crosses.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-what-next&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-what-next&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-play&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;play&quot;&gt;Play!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-play&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once you have tired of playing against your new-fledged playmate, change it up.
Rewrite the program with other data representations:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;org-ol&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep track of the moves, not the board;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;rewrite the board as an object;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;use a three-by-three matrix instead of a 9 character long string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Or improve it! The program could:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;org-ol&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;choose better moves (not just the least worst);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;take symmetry into account, as a three-by-three grid is highly symmetrical;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;use alpha beta pruning;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;have a plusher user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alternatively, you can translate the program to another programming language.
Or you can create an adversary for another game. Consult your nearest games
cupboard for inspiration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-further-afield&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To venture further into the cybernetic meadows, let Richard Brautigan, Andrew
Ng, &lt;i&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/i&gt; by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville,
and &lt;i&gt;Neural Networks and Learning Machines&lt;/i&gt; by Simon Haykin be your guides.
&lt;i&gt;Bon voyage!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Elvis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
‘Come on, choose a song!’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Four pairs of eyes implore me to pick up the mic. We’re in a dingy room
with a bucket of ice cooling beer bottles set on a low table encircled by a
wrap-around sofa. Three walls need their decor updating; the fourth barely
holds up a beastly screen, blinking at us for input.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘All right, all right. Put the cat king on.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The four faces turn into question marks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Elvis Presley,’ I elaborate, switching to English. ‘The cat king!’ I repeat,
switching back to Mandarin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The four question marks continue to stare at me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘The coolest man ever! The American. The 1950s. &lt;i&gt;Love Me Tender&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;i&gt;Jailhouse
Rock&lt;/i&gt;?’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My four companions continue to stare at me. I am being treated to my own
medicine, I think. For the past month, we’ve been roving around bars, electric
with youth, playing dice, eating vodka-drenched watermelon, telling tall tales
over blaring hip-hop, playing pool in smoke-filled backrooms, grimacing over
mahjong tables, cooling off in outdoor swimming pools. And now, we’ve piled
into a kareoke booth giggling, and for the first time, I’m not the clueless
one, asking what the hell is going on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Let me show you.’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
猫王 turns up two results. I opt for &lt;i&gt;Blue Suede Shoes&lt;/i&gt;. The poses come out.
The fun kicks in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My new friends lean back, swigging on lager, and enjoy the show. Li Ziyi and Li
Zier, sister and brother, share a knowing glance. They had spotted me at
sea in Shenzhen a month ago, and taken an interest in the Chinese-speaking
foreigner. Why had I come? What was I up to? How about we grab a bite? Since
then, we’ve been hanging out every evening and weekend; joined by Jia
Shangshan, the charmer from Shanghai with a permanent cigarette jutting from
the corner of his mouth which wags as he enraptures his latest entourage with
his next fat fib; and Duo Yige, who paired with Li Ziyi, can belt out any
soaring, raucous, Whitney Houston-esque Mandarin ballad. Duo Yige has a
fantastically cheeky grin too. A grin not there when I finish my last Elvis
grunt. They’re all perplexed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Ah yeah, you see, back then, in the West, cool people were called cats,’ I
explain. ‘And Elvis was the coolest of them all, right? That’s why he’s
called Cat King in Chinese!’ My eyes gleam. It is one of my favourite English
to Chinese name translations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My friends disagree. ‘How– just how can a cat be cool?’ asks Li Ziyi.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The notion seems ridiculous. I guess many notions of cool seem ridiculous. I’m
still baffled as to how geil (horny in German) means cool. Lekker (meaning
tasty in most Germanic languages, but also cool in Afrikaans and Dutch) makes
more sense to me. But why then, do Danes and Swedes opt for fed/fett (fat)
instead? And what do Norwegians say? What a mystery.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
‘Cat got your tongue?’ riffs Li Zier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I open my mouth to try and explain about Squeeze’s &lt;i&gt;Cool for Cats&lt;/i&gt;, about the
cool music video, about how the music video was filmed at John Lennon’s old
house, and how Lennon was cool, and how the Beatles were cool. There’s the
whole Beat generation: &lt;i&gt;On the Road&lt;/i&gt; is chockful of crazy cats and madcats. I
think of Top Cat, with his cool hat. Of course, there’s also Cool Cat, who’s
called Cool Cat. And then there’s Pink Panther, the cat with the coolest theme
tune of them all, on saxophone. That’s cool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But then I remember Andrew Lloyd Webber’s &lt;i&gt;Cats&lt;/i&gt;, and close my mouth again,
slinking away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Edutainment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An arrow skewers my foot. A flock follows, darting above our heads, destined
for our flesh, damning us to the ward and worse. I load the rifle and yell out
instructions, and in pain. Those still standing speed through the movements,
with eyes scanning the hills and bushes. But already they’re in our faces.
Bullets wait within barrels as we jab, thrust, parry, pirouette. Blade meets
javelin, dagger splices shield, body hits floor, Death laughs aloud. The
carnage has stopp-. Why? I can’t believe it. It can’t end here. Why does it
always have to crash at this bit? But I won this time!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I never got &lt;i&gt;Empire Total War&lt;/i&gt; to run on my computer. Every time the first
scene would play out, and regardless of the outcome, a black screen would greet
me. In its stead, &lt;i&gt;Napoleon Total War&lt;/i&gt; taught me about the Egyptian and Italian
campaigns, about Prussia, about howitzers; but I never discovered the
Peninsular Campaign DLC, having eschewed the few video games I played for extra
page-turning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My eyes dart across, scanning shelves and titles, searching for a friendly book
amongst the reams of hostile drudgery patiently biding their time to ensnare
another unwitting op-shop-shopper. &lt;i&gt;Death To The French&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Death To The French&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;i&gt;Death To The French&lt;/i&gt;. My fingers cleave the spine out
from the sagging bookcase. 1810. Portugal. C. S. Forester rings a bell. But do
I really want to read a military book, perfumed with English exceptionalism and
mild xenophobia? 1933? Why would anybody have written in 1933 about the
Peninsular War instead of the Great War? What was the Peninsular War anyway? I
buy the book.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hunger and hunger and hunger pervades the story, incessantly searing through
the plot scorching the characters. The mad, but stoic, Englishman harries the
crazy, and emotional, Frenchmen with help from the sane, but pathetic,
Portuguese guerillas. And they are all starving. Rifleman Dodd, though mad, is
luckily mad for God, King and Country, and therefore prevails. God, King and
Country gift Dodd bread, to munch and munch and munch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After shutting the cover, the same questions still confound me. Did I really
want to read a military book, rife with English exceptionalism and mild
xenophobia? 1933? Why would anybody have written in 1933 about the Peninsular
War instead of the Great War? I guess I did find out about the Peninsular War
though.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;??????????????&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿̣&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches
of language and existence. Some of them fall off, but others cling on
desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness, stuffing
themselves with delicious food and drink. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen,’ they yell,
‘we are floating in space!’ But none of the people down there care.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoter&quot;&gt;Sophie’s World&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Napoleon Total War&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Death To The French&lt;/i&gt; subtly hoodwinked me
into learning about Prussia and howitzers and starvation by packing in nuggets
of history between fun and guns. &lt;i&gt;Sophie’s World&lt;/i&gt;, on the other hand, is just
one big nugget of history, wearing a fake glasses-nose-moustache combo. Without
any guns.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the fake glasses-nose-moustache combo, &lt;i&gt;Sophie’s World&lt;/i&gt; attempts to
disguise itself as a novel, when it is in fact &lt;i&gt;A Fourteen Year Old (Almost
Fifteen Year Old) Schoolchild’s Introduction to (Western) Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;. A plot
is slapped on, with the audience and author standing in for the characters,
Sophie and Alberto, respectively. Indeed, the whole trick of novelisation is
laid bare to the reader, girders and all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Jostein Gaarder sets out to create a sense of wonder, the wonder of
contemplating the Universe, the wonder of watching a masterful magician change
a couple of white silk scarves into a live rabbit. But Gaarder brings out the
white rabbit onto the stage, coerces it into the top hat with its floppy ears
and chubby cheeks still hanging out, and then proceeds to reveal the
carrot-muncher in the top hat. Ta-da! How’s that for entertainment?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The textbook is great; the rest, mere bagatelle. But translated into the medium
of a 90s video game, &lt;i&gt;Sophie’s World&lt;/i&gt; is unrecognisable. Ethereal and
ponderous, &lt;i&gt;Sophie’s World&lt;/i&gt; slows down the Universe outside, a force exudes
from it curbing the pace of Nature, warping space, shooing me up a wizard’s
sleeze. Life waits tethered outside as thoughts rocket, dazzle, jab, thrust,
parry, pirouette. Idea meets counterpoint, fun splices ennui, mood hits right,
Absurdists laugh silently. A spirit within promises nirv- No! Why? I can’t
believe it. It can’t end h-
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Le Ton beau de Marot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;verse&quot;&gt;
This poem&lt;br /&gt;
is going&lt;br /&gt;
to devil&lt;br /&gt;
my mettle.&lt;br /&gt;
My mind&#x27;s jammed&lt;br /&gt;
by these damned&lt;br /&gt;
rhymes: A A&lt;br /&gt;
B B… Pray,&lt;br /&gt;
God save me.&lt;br /&gt;
How can three&lt;br /&gt;
miserable&lt;br /&gt;
syllables,&lt;br /&gt;
fourteen pairs,&lt;br /&gt;
wring despairs&lt;br /&gt;
such as these?&lt;br /&gt;
My ill ease&lt;br /&gt;
only grows&lt;br /&gt;
when I pose&lt;br /&gt;
this question:&lt;br /&gt;
‘Translation:&lt;br /&gt;
all in vain?’&lt;br /&gt;
‘No!’ Doug claims,&lt;br /&gt;
as Clément&lt;br /&gt;
retains &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
even in&lt;br /&gt;
(though you grin,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Fun&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seated, I survey the venue from the mezzanine, sipping on 4 dollar lemonade.
Two young girdled men take to the stage; one wields a guitar, the other dabbles
with keys and digital miscellania. With the pulpit still bare, they begin.
Electronic pulses ooze out. The man on the keys, the stouter of the two,
dressed in a white turtleneck and whiter trousers, sings catchy tunes out of
tune.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a fantastic video recording of an early Kraftwerk gig. The audience
for electronic music did not exist yet; so a hodge-podge of subcultures
constitute the punters, hippies arm-in-arm with proto-punks, mullets with
cardigans and eyeliner. When the show started, the packed sedentary curiosity
seekers were clueless of the étiquette for witnessing these new sounds which
heralded the new age. Some meditated; others headbanged, fists included. Yet
more gawped, their gaping mouths preserved for posterity on tape.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On stage, Barley Passable progress through a kaleidoscope of Euro pop,
electro pop, house, disco — a mélange-mischung of French house and Teutonic
electro — Daft Punk and Berlin nightclubs and too many hours of Eurovision
distilled through teenage Australian ears. “It would be better if they were
German,” opines my partner. I concur. But now, as the crowd swells below, and
the duo start their own Kraftwerk version of the macarena, helped by alcoholic
vapours swirling in the lights, old memories of fun seep through my stupor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I croak up, free my locks, shift my way down the stairs to join in, and spill
lemonade over my brogues.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;We Liars&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Angus is sitting in the corner, in his wedding dress, playing with three red
juggling balls. He throws them all up at once. Again. And again. He keeps
muttering, ‘this time.’ I watch him with half an eye. After a while, I see he
won’t be achieving whatever it is he has in mind soon, so I don a pair of
headphones and press &lt;i&gt;The Start&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Angus exhales as various electronics begin to purr. He dusts off his wedding
dress and walks towards me, flanked by a choir who yearn for something,
something just out of …
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A harp twists and the corner falls away, revealing a vast green. Angus invites
me to take his arms as we pass by an array of oblong strings and gusts of
triangles, gurgling mouths without bodies. ‘Where are we going?’ I ask. I’m
too afraid to ask where we are.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bleeps and bloops jerk my limbs to ecstatic rhythms. Angus towers all six foot
six of himself, wailing, lecturing, howling, over me, and the rest. The
crowd, the mustachioed mass, subsumes me; I osmose myself into this kicking,
dust-purple fantasy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Three red suns lineate the sky. A ladder stretches asymptotically high. We
climb, struggle together, up, blown by multi-coloured lengths of string
dancing to falsetto honky tonk bitter harmonies emanating from a lounge fan. We
reach the top, we turn our eyes heavenwards, we peer, we see scrawled in pen:
&lt;i&gt;YES&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Зверь&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;org47bd748&quot; class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./the-beast.webp&quot; alt=&quot;the-beast.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What is there to do in Duisburg? To start with, perhaps a saunter around the
world&#x27;s largest inland harbour? Restaurants hug its banks, keen for a view of
the concrete basin. Further to the city centre, kebab stalls line
the pathways. There&#x27;s even a theater where the latest misguided, desperate and
lost troupe find themselves performing to the vestiges of a decaying
post-industrial city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My mother opts to take me and my brother to the library, undoubtedly due to
the lack of internet access in our newly rented accommodation. As the weeks
tick by, we are still waiting for a professional to rock up with a router,
plug it into the tangle of the Internet and chant a few choice incantations
to bless our bare abode with megabits and millisecond pings. My mother&#x27;s unable
to wait for the famed efficiency of Teutonic bureaucracy: she has electronic
mail to read.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scowering past the rows of shelves brimming with Goethe, Mann, Schiller and
odd spines with spiky Fraktur characters, I search for reading more suited to
my ability. My pathetic attempt a few days ago to ask where swimwear and
goggles could be bought at our new local swimming pool, blatantly
demonstrated that three years of German lessons in England had not amounted to
much.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I spy some teenage fiction I&#x27;ve read before. Alex Rider, perfect! Knowing the
characters, premise and plot should make reading in a new language a less
foreboding task. Alas, the first few words of German already muddle my mind.
But then, I finally stumble upon the jackpot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Garfield.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Full of indispensable vocabulary, such as &quot;Pastaspäher&quot;, &quot;Lasagne&quot; and &quot;Nein&quot;,
Garfield quickly equips me with the essentials needed to navigate these new
environs.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;orgeef51a8&quot; class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./the-beast-2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;the-beast-2.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#x27;m free this weekend. Typing &lt;code&gt;Events in Sydney&lt;/code&gt; into my web browser reveals a
Japanese film festival at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Skimming through
the blurbs, the phrase &quot;experimental horror&quot; pops out. I know exactly who
will join me for this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt; is a fusillade on the brain cells and a smorgasbord of filmic
delights&amp;#x2026; Described as ‘unhinged extreme’, &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt; (aka &lt;i&gt;Hausu&lt;/i&gt;) is an
experimental horror film that amalgamates 1970s pop culture with mysterious
phenomenology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We arrive, settle in, and a white cat appears.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;org5093cbf&quot; class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./russian-course.webp&quot;
alt=&quot;russian-course.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Packing for a weekend is an art I have perfected. My backpack fits a rolled-up
shirt, a couple of changes of underwear, a book, an apple or two and a water
bottle. My jacket, coat, sweater and trousers can easily last a weekend, even
with long-haul bus trips. A toothbrush and perhaps a perfume bottle can be
stowed away into one of the side pockets; everything else can be borrowed when
I reach my destination. Oslo, Copenhagen, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Geneva,
Madrid, each weekend there&#x27;s another friend to visit, another festival to
attend, another chance to snatch a moment together with my partner, to remove
the telephone which separates our voices, to feel her breath on my skin, to
violate the definition of &quot;long-distance relationship&quot; for a few glorious days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Packing for life with my partner on a new continent has me stumped. What parts
of myself do I want to keep? Which clothes, hobbies, memories, dreams,
affectations will match our new surroundings?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We&#x27;ve already decided on bringing a musical instrument each, which leaves one
suitcase and one piece of hand luggage. Crockery, cutlery, clothes will be easy
to find in charity shops once we&#x27;re in Sydney. Books too, and if not then
surely at a library. As I stack my books onto bookshelves and unpack and pack
them from storage boxes, I pick up a battered textbook, &lt;i&gt;The New Penguin
Russian Course&lt;/i&gt;. The receipt remains inside, the date marks the length of time
I have failed to realise a naïve teenage dream to learn Russian. A certain
stubbornness washes over me and I resolve to finish what I started eight years
ago. I place the book in my carry-on pile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Two flights later, and many more reading hours, I reach the end of Nicholas
Brown&#x27;s text. What&#x27;s next? I&#x27;m not sure if Garfield has been translated into
Russian, but surely the Harry Potters have. Indeed, I spot a couple of the
later books at Abbey&#x27;s Bookshop, but there&#x27;s no Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&amp;#x2026; I order
a copy at the counter and pick up &lt;i&gt;New Penguin Parallel Text Short Stories in
Russian&lt;/i&gt; to tide me over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I leaf through, a дедушка consoles me, before arms reach out from the pages
and grasp onto me, arms of widows selling the remains of their war-hero
husbands, an arm tattooed on the sea, the still shaking arms of a priest
executioner.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once in, I see him. He is waiting for me as if it were time to introduce
himself. He is sitting in the armchair - a huge, confident cat - with his
chubby cheeks turned toward me.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Develop a Hello World alert for Windows on Arch Linux</title>
        <link>https://christianchristiansen.net/log/windows.html</link>

        <description>

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Develop a Hello World alert for Windows on Arch Linux&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only proceed when all possibilities to avoid Windows have dried up.
Proceed with care and suspicion: Clippy takes no prisoners.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org6d9cd8b&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org6d9cd8b&quot;&gt;Step 1: Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org6d9cd8b&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Write the program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;helloword.cpp&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-C++&quot;&gt;#ifndef UNICODE // Not strictly necessary, but good practice
#define UNICODE
#endif

#include &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt; // Use Windows libraries

int WINAPI wWinMain(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,     // Handle to current instance
    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, // Handle to previous instance of application
    PWSTR pCmdLine,          // Command line arguments as Unicode string
    int nCmdShow)            // Open minimised, maximised, or normally
{
    MessageBox (
        NULL,            // Handle to owner of the message box
        L&quot;Hello world!&quot;, // Message to be displayed
        L&quot;Hello&quot;,        // Pop-up title
        MB_OKCANCEL);    // Contents and behaviour of pop-up
    return 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Further documentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/winmain--the-application-entry-point&quot;&gt;wWinMain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox&quot;&gt;MessageBox&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org024b75b&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org024b75b&quot;&gt;Step 2: GNU Compiler Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org024b75b&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compile the program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Running &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; without any modifications will not work, as we require
supplementary Windows libraries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;sudo pacman -S mingw-w64-headers mingw-w64-cpp
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then if we run
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ helloworld.cpp
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
we will get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58324230/undefined-reference-to-winmain-c-mingw&quot;&gt;error&lt;/a&gt; about an &lt;code&gt;undefined reference to `WinMain&#x27;&lt;/code&gt; . What we&#x27;re
missing is the flag &lt;code&gt;-municode&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -municode helloworld.cpp
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Out pops &lt;code&gt;a.exe&lt;/code&gt;. We have now created our first Windows program on Arch Linux!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orgdab56e0&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgdab56e0&quot;&gt;Step 3: Wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgdab56e0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Run the program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org&quot;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; allows us to run Windows programs on Linux. To install Wine on Arch Linux,
we will first have to enable the &lt;code&gt;multilib&lt;/code&gt; repository by uncommenting two
lines in &lt;code&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;# [multilib]
# Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then update the repositories, and install the following packages:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S wine wine-mono
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Run
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;wine a.exe
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and bask in triumph.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;./windows.webp&quot; alt=&quot;windows.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orge162603&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orge162603&quot;&gt;Further steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orge162603&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Write more programs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Try following &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program&quot;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; on creating more involved Windows programs.

Rock climbing, guitar playing, ivory tickling, and GNU Emacs have all become
inextricable parts of my life. And all of them demand far too much of my left
pinky. After slightly straining my left wrist on a crimpy dynamic slab, I have
become acutely aware of the punishing ritual I subject my weakest finger to
from dawn till dusk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_pinky.html&quot;&gt;Emacs pinky&lt;/a&gt; is an undeniable issue amongst programmers. I already alleviate
stress by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil&quot;&gt;evil-mode&lt;/a&gt;, remapping &lt;code&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Escape&lt;/code&gt;, and raising my
wrists above the keyboard by shoving a sweater underneath my arms. However, I
still expect my left pinky to auto-complete with &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt;, return to command mode
with &lt;code&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/code&gt; (masquerading as &lt;code&gt;Escape&lt;/code&gt;), capitalise letters with &lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt;,
change buffers (and run countless other Emacs commands) with &lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt;, switch
windows via &lt;a href=&quot;https://swaywm.org&quot;&gt;sway&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;/code&gt; (aka &lt;code&gt;Meta&lt;/code&gt; or the Windows key), and, of course,
press &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; to help summon the genie &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;M-x&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I should surely be able to find some method to further reduce my poor digit&#x27;s
burden.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orgd25080a&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgd25080a&quot;&gt;Space as a leading key?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgd25080a&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Doom Emacs and Spacemacs eschew &lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt; in favour of &lt;code&gt;Space&lt;/code&gt; for commands.
The briefest of flirtations with Doom has convinced me for life that there is
nothing as perverse as using another human&#x27;s Emacs config. Afer restoring my
&lt;code&gt;~/.emacs.d/&lt;/code&gt; and sanity, I found no easy way to extricate the leading space
behaviour from either Doom and Spacemacs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I delved further into abandoned forums to seek a more viable (and less deviant)
option.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orgc47425e&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgc47425e&quot;&gt;Caps as Escape and Control?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgc47425e&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/caps2esc&quot;&gt;caps2esc&lt;/a&gt; showed promise. It remaps not only &lt;code&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Escape&lt;/code&gt;, but also
allows &lt;code&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/code&gt; to act as &lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt; whilst it is held down. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/space2meta/&quot;&gt;space2meta&lt;/a&gt;
remaps &lt;code&gt;Space&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Meta&lt;/code&gt; (aka &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;/code&gt;) whilst it is held down. And both run on
the &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt; level so they are window manager agnostic and work in TTY!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started copy-pasting code and creating my own &lt;code&gt;caps2meta&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return2meta&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;space2ctrl&lt;/code&gt;, until I thought there must be an even better solution.
And, indeed, there is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orgc620fc9&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgc620fc9&quot;&gt;Dual Function Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgc620fc9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/dual-function-keys&quot;&gt;Dual Function Keys&lt;/a&gt; allows anybody to remap any key to any other key when it is
tapped, double-tapped or held down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To install on Arch Linux, simply:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;sudo pacman -S interception-dual-function-keys
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then create a YAML file describing the key remappings required. In my personal
config: &lt;code&gt;Caps Lock&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;Escape&lt;/code&gt; when tapped, and &lt;code&gt;Meta&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;/code&gt; when
held; &lt;code&gt;Space&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; when held; &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;Return&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;Meta&lt;/code&gt; /
&lt;code&gt;Super&lt;/code&gt; when held.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;~/.config/dfk.yaml&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-yaml&quot;&gt;TIMING:
    TAP_MILLISEC: 200
    DOUBLE_TAP_MILLISEC: 150

MAPPINGS:
    - KEY: KEY_CAPSLOCK
      TAP: KEY_ESC
      HOLD: KEY_LEFTMETA

    - KEY: KEY_SPACE
      TAP: KEY_SPACE
      HOLD: KEY_LEFTCTRL

    - KEY: KEY_ENTER
      TAP: KEY_ENTER
      HOLD: KEY_LEFTMETA
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Create a YAML file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/interception/udevmon.d/&lt;/code&gt; for the system
configuration.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/etc/interception/udevmon.d/keys.yaml&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-yaml&quot;&gt;- JOB: intercept -g $DEVNODE | dual-function-keys -c /path/to/dfk.yaml | uinput -d $DEVNODE
  DEVICE:
    EVENTS:
      EV_KEY: [KEY_CAPSLOCK, KEY_SPACE, KEY_ENTER]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now to get the keybindings up and running:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;sudo udevmon
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To have the keybindings start automatically at boot-time:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;org-src-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-sh&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl enable udevmon
sudo systemctl start udevmon
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org0bf2b04&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org0bf2b04&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org0bf2b04&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Et voilà! My thumb and right pinky can now relieve my left pinky of most of its
duties. And I&#x27;ll soon be back on the wall, cursing crimpy dynamic slabs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;FBi Radio currently playing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./fbiradio.webp&quot; alt=&quot;fbiradio.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Amongst all the wild and fantastical affairs humans partake in, music is by far
the most baffling. We indoctrinate our infants with lullabies, make pilgrimages
to clubs, festivals and operas, and buy our groceries whilst barely pubescent
teenagers serenade us over tinny tannoys. There are no clear evolutionary
advantages associated with an appreciation of Bach&#x27;s fugues or gabber; music is
an inexplicable and joyous byproduct of the human condition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since arriving in Australia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fbiradio.com&quot;&gt;FBi Radio&lt;/a&gt;, the independent non-profit radio station
which plays 50% Australian music (of which 50% is from New South Wales), has
satiated my desire for novel tracks and artists, and helped me to delve into the
local culture and survive a year without the euphoria of dancing with a
hundred fellow revelers. Tkay Maidza, 3NDLES5, Crazymike, Shady Nasty, Low
Flung, Party Dozen, Cool Sounds, &amp;#x2026; (the list is far too long to properly
compile) - they all immeasurably improved my year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With so many great artists and tracks on FBi, I&#x27;ve struggled with having to
visit the website, find the current program, and scroll to locate what&#x27;s
currently playing everytime my ears are piqued. To solve this, I have created a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cchristiansen/fbiradio/&quot;&gt;Python script&lt;/a&gt;. Now I just have to type &lt;code&gt;fbiplaying&lt;/code&gt; and the answer falls right
into my lap. Now excuse me - I need to check out what the current track is.
It&#x27;s wild.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Listen to 94.5 FM.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;La Fille aux yeux d&#x27;or&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../portfolio/la-fille-painting.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lights go back on. The punters shield their eyes, wipe sweat off their
foreheads, trickle out, past the cloakroom onto Oxford Street, lighting up,
with grins larger than faces.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tuesday 2&lt;sup style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; December 2014, at the 100 Club,
London. Iceage have just completed a seering set, whilst touring off the back
of their third album.  &lt;cite&gt;Plowing Into the Field of Love&lt;/cite&gt; saw the
Danish punk band expand, explore, embrace a greater lyrical and musical
landscape, delving into instrumentation and lyrical themes only hinted at in
the nihilistic &lt;cite&gt;You&#x27;re Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;, whilst retaining their sharpness,
their danger.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;q&gt;The only current punk band I can think of that sounds really dangerous.&lt;/q&gt;
- Iggy Pop. Danger evident throughout today&#x27;s gig. The gaggle who had turned
out this evening were hard to discern, Nick Cave fans, posers, remnants from past
tours, and those who simply wanted to steal a glance of the handsome quartet.
But from the first twang of guitar, it was evident who the bulk of the audience
were. They shoved, dived, shouted back lyrics, with raised fists. They were
here to see the best punk band in punk&#x27;s own city. And they have. On their way
out, palpable satisfaction hangs in the sweaty air.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The unmistakable hiss of an amp comes back on. Confusion erupts.
&quot;Iceage don&#x27;t do encores?!&quot; But the foursome are back on, and we pile back
in. I reach the front, crash onto the stage, thrust by the mob behind. I lie
there, staring up, watching from below Elias Rønnenfelt bewitch the ruckus
abound. Watching our generation&#x27;s Elvis, our Bob Dylan, our Ian Curtis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1;&quot;&gt;Raise your fists
For the depraved roses
Raise it today
Everything drifts
Soon it&#x27;s gone
Don&#x27;t find a place to stay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 105px; height: 60px;&quot; src=&quot;iceage-logos.webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today, five years on, I am listening to the crooners from the antipodes. The
gang of four have swelled and gained a guitarist, and a maraca shaker. The
fury of the mosh pit is replaced with luxurious lounge listening.
Cowboy tassels, snakeskin boots, 1000-mile
stares are being filmed live by a camera crew courtesy of Brodie Sessions, as
Iceage saunter through songs inspired by Mina, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and
Samuel Beckett. The spectacle finishes with a rendition of &lt;cite&gt;Lockdown
Blues&lt;/cite&gt;, their latest covid-19 inspired single.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Incontent with simply providing a new single, a wondrous livestreamed show, and
a vast backlog of influences to uncover, Iceage have also contributed a list of
suggested books for reading over this pandemic period:
&lt;cite&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/cite&gt; by Toni Morrison, &lt;cite&gt;Papillon&lt;/cite&gt; by
Henry Charrière, &lt;cite&gt;The Happy Birthday of Death&lt;/cite&gt; by Gregory Corso,
&lt;cite&gt;God&#x27;s Mistress&lt;/cite&gt; by James Galvin, and &lt;cite&gt;The Girl with the
Golden Eyes&lt;/cite&gt; by Honoré de Balzac.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;the-girl-with-the-golden-eyes.webp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I ordered a copy of &lt;cite&gt;The Girl with the Golden Eyes&lt;/cite&gt;; the book&#x27;s
cover posed even more questions than the title (never mind the blurb:
&lt;q&gt; The greatest French novelist of all time tells the story of a man enslaved
by a strange girl who bewitched him, ignited his passion, taught him all the
ways of love and then revealed herself as captive to the most grotesque
perversion known to human flesh&lt;/q&gt;). Count me in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Chapter 1, even in translation, unveiled a new realm of linguistic
possibilities to me; Balzac&#x27;s descriptions of Parisian society uprooted my
notions of what language is capable of expressing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1; &quot;&gt;
Thus we are brought to the third circle of this hell, which, perhaps, will some
day find its Dante. In this third social circle, a sort of Parisian belly, in
which the interest of the town are digested, and where they are condensed into
the form known as &lt;i&gt;business&lt;/i&gt;, there moves and agitates, as by some acrid
and bitter intestinal process, the crowd of lawyers, doctors, notaries,
councillors, business men, bankers, big merchants, speculators and magistrates.
Here are to be found even more causes of moral and physical destruction than
elsewhere. These people - almost all of them - live in unhealthy offices, in
fetid ante-chambers, in little barred dens, and spend their days bowed down
beneath the weight of affairs; they rise at dawn to be in time, not to be left
behind, to gain all or not to lose, to over-reach a man or his money, to open or
wind up some business, to take advantage of some fleeting opportunity, to get a
man hanged or set him free. They infect their horses, they over-drive and age
and break them, like their own legs, before their time. Time is their tyrant: it
fails them, it escapes them; they can neither expand it nor cut it short. What
soul can remain great, pure, moral and generous, and, consequently, what face
retain its beauty in this depraving practice of a calling which compels one to
bear the weight of the public sorrows, to analyse them, to weight them,
estimate them, and mark them out by rule? Where do these folk put aside their
hearts?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is a shame that chapter 2 goes on to explore the limits of story telling
with wafer-thin characterisation, an incredulous plot, wanton literary and
cultural references, and scarcely discernible narration. And an abrupt ending.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First commit to KDE. Christian Christiansen.</title>
        <link>https://christianchristiansen.net/log/kde-first-commit.html</link>

        <description>


&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;First commit to KDE&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of reading Linux Format, then Linux Voice, now finding refuge
in &lt;a href=&quot;https://latenightlinux.com/&quot;&gt;Late Night Linux&lt;/a&gt;; after scouring
through countless forums over a decade ago to ornate my desktop with ever
fancier bling (and wobblier windows); after wrecking multiple installations
from ever more ridiculous projects (who knew that running state-of-the-art
games through Wine on a tiny Sony Vaio laptop without a GPU wasn&#x27;t a sensible
idea?), I have finally contributed back to the open source community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across a recommendation to read the excellent
&lt;a href=&quot;https://producingoss.com&quot;&gt;Producing Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt; by Karl
Fogel.
The book demystified the inner workings of open source, and had me itching to
join in. So I set about on a mission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Hang out on IRC.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what&#x27;s happening.
To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t see much happening on IRC, but I quickly became
frustrated by Konversation&#x27;s inability to log my nickname in automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Find out what the issue was.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently NickServ is no
longer the go-to identification service and I should have been using SASL
instead. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400362&quot;&gt;Why wasn&#x27;t that
the default?&lt;/a&gt; Nobody was able to say - everybody seemed to think it was a
sensible idea. Time to get stuck in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Get the build environment running.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a real pain, despite KDE&#x27;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development&quot;&gt;impeccable wiki
&lt;/a&gt; to help get started. Although LTS releases are
incredibly useful for a multitude of reasons, I found out the hard way
that they&#x27;re ill-suited for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Change the code.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And test, test, test. Diving into new territory always contains several
unforeseen pitfalls. However, I soon had something working, and sent it off
to review. Again, KDE has
&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Phabricator&quot;&gt;excellent
documentation&lt;/a&gt; for newcomers. After a minor edit...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Celebrate.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got accepted! Woohoo! Champagne for everyone¹!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah wait, somebody on the #konversation channel has found another annoying
bug... Hold my flute.&lt;/p&gt;
