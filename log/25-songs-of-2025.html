<h1 class="title">25 songs and tracks of 2025</h1>
<p>
Little, if any, of 2025’s broader zeitgeist has been reflected in the best
music of the year. <i>Facing War</i>, a documentary following the trials and
tribulations of Jens Stoltenberg, the former Secretary General of NATO, shows a
world which is more split, strung between multiple possible nightmares, whilst
war and worse rage on. Possibly 2025’s best album of the year, <i>Big City Life</i>
by Smerz, exists in a parallel reality. Catharina Stoltenberg (Jens’s daughter)
and Henriette Motzfeldt are two of the torch-bearers for a new sound coming
from between and beyond Nørrebro and Vesterbro. With bare outlines, these
twenty-and-thirty-year-olds allow our imaginations to roam unexplored terrains.
Straddling new digital and urban worlds, we find nostalgia for a never time,
the allure of the dancefloor, and romance – as it ever was.

<h2 id="orgddd67e1">25. Debbie Sings – Sunny Skies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgddd67e1">
<p>
Power poptimists rejoice, with synths this obnoxious there’s no shame left to
lose. Embrace the crucifix of amps, emblaze your crop-top with a font tackier
than <i>brat</i> and get down like it’s 2007 round Ed Banger’s. Debbie Sings, we
party.

<h2 id="org61d72d1">24. CHRIST DILLINGER – RIP HULK HOGAN</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org61d72d1">
<p>
Sincerity and satire have never been paired so beautifully together before.
Simultaneously grotesque, enthralling and hilarious, Christ Dillinger’s tribute
to self-professed racist and America’s greatest ever wrestler foregrounds
the ugly reality of who our entertainers are.

<h2 id="org7628d7c">23. Surgeon – Forgotten Gods</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7628d7c">
<p>
God knows a.m. or is it p.m.? All that matters is the beat, the next beat and
the space compressing and decompressing between. The right combination of
venue, crowd, sound system and track selection allows techno to work its magic
and enrapture its audience. With Forgotten Gods, Surgeon shows that he sure
knows all the conjuring tricks.

<div id="outline-container-orgc14d3a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc14d3a7">22. Roberto Musci – Persistence of Vision</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc14d3a7">
<p>
The best contemplative pieces offer fertile soundscapes to plant new ideas and
watch them grow. Each listen may sprout vastly different shapes, but the
shadings of light and dark stay the same, providing set twists for thoughts to
navigate, as sounds move us from one space to another. Finely balanced, richly
rewarding.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1c65f37">
<p>
Percussion, repetition, cycles of saxophone, spoken word, repeated, spoken
word, cycles of saxophone, contemplations, again, percussion, contemplate. See?

<h2 id="org093a9d3">20. Avalon Emerson &amp; the Charm – Eden</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org093a9d3">
<p>
Breezy summers may evoke a certain care-freeness; what worries burden
sun-kissed faces? But long evenings allow old emotions to blow in, linger and
settle. Memories sharpen and resolutions to uphold past promises restore. For
Eden.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc4293ce" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc4293ce">19. Kathryn Mohr – Horizonless</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc4293ce">
<p>
It is dark outside already. Dusk is closing in on a dreary day, spent jogging
across wet leaves and wandering Viking graves. Clouds stretch past the
horizons, and beyond. There is a certain serenity to be enjoyed. Crackle of
rain, hiss of wind, the irrefutability of the season.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1e1db04" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1e1db04">18. Haloplus+ – Open Air Backseat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1e1db04">
<p>
The liminal spaces in between our digital and non-digital realities remain
under-explored, though recently a couple of groups in and around Copenhagen
have set down a few poufs in the gaps between CPH and tucked–away Internet
snugs, grabbed a guitar and made themselves at home. These new Enos make Music
for Internet Airports –  and it’s bloody good.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7a80f59" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7a80f59">17. Oxis – Long Sardine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a80f59">
<p>
Oxis may claim there is something fishy at play here. But to the contrary.
Nostalgia is a simple longing for simpler times, evoked here by a simple ditty.
A fleeting wish, which slips away as quickly as it appeared.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org854ad49" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org854ad49">16. oqbqbo &amp; Scandinavian Star – Sun Up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org854ad49">
<p>
Terrifying infernos broiling with energy beam their light and brighten our
skies. During the long Scandinavian summer, the brilliance imbues positivity.
Sun Up, chin up – it’s all going to be alright.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd99d5d0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd99d5d0">15. Joanne Robertson and Oliver Coates – Gown</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd99d5d0">
<p>
From softly strum guitars, dulcet yet powerful strings and a voice which drifts
and glitters, Joanne Robertson weaves together the most invitingly hearty and
dazzling gown to curl up in and feel the waves of time crashing gently by.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb006143" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb006143">14. Vanessa Amara – Love won’t love you</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb006143">
<p>
Each weekend, organs around the world sound to announce the arrival of the
bride and the impending nuptial union. Here, the organs sound a warning, or
perhaps they ruminate on the unidirectionality of love. It’s complicated,
either way.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org18458c5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org18458c5">13. RIP Swirl – Let’s Make Out (featuring Ydegirl)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18458c5">
<p>
The strains of desire can cripple a budding romantic’s heart by tearing their
inner world this way and that. In momentary swirling flashes though, the
tensions can align and all pull together in the same direction towards one
simple desire. Let’s Make Out is less an invitation, more a crying out for
resolution.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge56f298" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge56f298">12. Smerz – You got time and I got money - VVTZJ EDIT (featuring Clairo)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge56f298">
<p>
An instant classic love song reimagined for the ballroom, to slow dance to
under flickering chandeliers. Clairo’s breathy vocals fill the air,
intertwining with the dreamy electric guitar and Smerz’s calm collected
delivery. The effect builds and builds, as powerful as any ballad, before
disappearing away behind thick veils into digital noise.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdeb69ff" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdeb69ff">11. Tyler, The Creator – Mommanem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdeb69ff">
<p>
Chest out, feet fleet, Tyler’s ready for a brawling. Run if you can. With Tyler
this livid, singing nursery rhymes about murder, you better pray it wasn’t you
who hurt his feelings. On his momma’nem.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf17ff3b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf17ff3b">10. Hekt – Beautiful</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf17ff3b">
<p>
With a surgeon’s precision, Hekt sculpts a banger. The drops’ smoothness belies
their ridicularity. Whether or not Hekt was grinning to himself whilst wielding
the scalpel is irrelevant, his artistry cannot be denied.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3895bc7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3895bc7">9. Fine – Portal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3895bc7">
<p>
The art of subtlety is perhaps the one core commonality binding the Copenhagen
scene. Stripped back sketches hint at the opportunities beyond the void. Flicks
of melody call forth orchestral arrangements of Wagnerian proportions. But a
moment later, the daydream shifts, and we’re back in our bedrooms accompanied
only by our own thoughts.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org58f35da" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org58f35da">8. Elias Rønnenfelt – Mona Lisa</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org58f35da">
<p>
There is an undeniably Romantic edge to Rønnenfelt. Elements of another age,
when da Vinci was at large or Bataille wrote of eroticism – Rønnenfelt may
feel most at home ‘hanging ’neath the Sistine Chapel ceiling in the air’. But
it is his urgency to capture the moment which truly makes his music timeless.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdb85bd9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdb85bd9">7. james K – Doom Bikini</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb85bd9">
<p>
The strength of feeling which coarses through me when <i>Doom Bikini</i> plays
easily outstrips my ability to coherently express the strength of those
feelings. james K has created a pop masterpiece with verses which glisten, even
better bridges which ratchet up the tension, and diabolical choruses. It is so
so so good.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7c0f909" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7c0f909">6. Soli City – Western Media</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c0f909">
<p>
Little of world events has seaped through to the cultural soundscape of 2025. A
vanguard of Kneecap and Bob Vylan is not exactly quite like
<i>God Save The Queen</i>, <i>I Feel Love</i>, or hell even whatever that first The X
Factor single was called, in capturing the sign of the times. Perhaps the
turbulence, speed and incomprehension of today is at fault. However, Soli
City’s clipped up musique concrète-ish piece shows how it is possible to still
strike a course through the noise.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org376bb96" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org376bb96">5. Anna B Savage – Talk To Me</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org376bb96">
<p>
In music, 2025 was the year of love. <i>brat</i> summer well and truly over, this
wasn’t love in the sense of hooking up, having a good time or loving labubus or
Limp Bizkit or whatever, it was inner peace and contentedness with those still
dear after post-after-party clarity. Seasides, snuggles, Sunday evening
Saturdays.
</p>

<p>
Love has rendered the dazzling acrobatics necessary to navigate the fault lines
in <i>in|FLUX</i> superfluous. Anna B Savage’s virtuosic vocals have gained maturity
and tenderness. With lullabies gentle enough to lull a bull, this is the true
power of love.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org64fe150" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org64fe150">4. Dean Blunt &amp; Elias Rønnenfelt – 7</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org64fe150">
<p>
It is cruel to tear <i>lucre</i> apart into separate pieces. Indeed, the intial drop
as one continuous sixteen-minute track in addition to the perfunctory numeric
track names very much suggests that Blunt &amp; co. intended <i>lucre</i> to be
savoured whole.
</p>

<p>
That being said, <i>7</i>​’s moody optimism shines, whether stand-alone or as a coda.
Though <i>5</i> may adorn Premier League footballers’ playlists, and <i>1</i> breezes
past with Rønnenfelt’s languid <i>da</i>​s, <i>lucre</i>​’s heftiest piece, allowed the
space to flourish, best exhibits Blunt’s prowess as a producer and
Rønnenfelt’s ability to exude emotion from each syllable, vowel and utterance.
Longing strings, warm guitars, clean percussion and drawled vocals have struck
up a tune often enough – but never quite like this.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org75d6c68" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org75d6c68">3. james K – Play</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org75d6c68">
<p>
I was loath to place the same artist twice upon this list, but allowed it in
the case of Rønnenfelt due to one of the tracks being a collaborative effort.
No such excuses for james K. Not even the excuse of different projects or
separate albums can save me. The strength of the music, however, can.
</p>

<p>
Trance as pop, breakdown as chorus, guitars as cool again, somehow.
<i>Friend</i> is stellar throughout – and there exist valid claims for <i>Doom Bikini</i>
to be the better song. But no other track of 2025 affirmed the importance and
poignancy of life as consistently for me.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf72a6a9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf72a6a9">2. Shanti Celeste – Romance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf72a6a9">
<p>
Dive into the irisdescent bubble gum synths, frolick amongst the honey-dipped
vocals, bathe in the warmth of romance, baby, I won’t even be mad at being
adressed as baby. The lusciousness of the mid-range and the infectiousness of
the slightly off-kilter stabs of bass leave you craving for more and more.
House at its finest evokes an irresistible high. Paired with pop, the
temptations just grow.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org71c1dd9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org71c1dd9">1. Smerz – You got time and I got money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org71c1dd9">
<p>
You know it, I know it, any self-respecting music-lover knows it, Smerz have
fashioned a love song for the ages. The rest of the list is completely subject
to the whims of my opinion, but <i>You got time and I got money</i> is hands down
the best song of the year. I was loath to give two entries to the same artist
or album, but <i>You got time and I got money</i> easily merits its double
appearance, and potentially warrants an additional third – it is simply that
good.
</p>

<p>
Love can be disarmingly simple, as simple as ‘I like your shoes, I like
these clean t-shirts on you’. It might even render us incapable of formulating
correct sentences, see ‘I wanna talk much’, and dut-dut-du-ing arpeggios
instead. But there is nothing banal about love.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks ago my partner and I sat in a sauna with the good company of three
friends, staring out at an ink-black Limfjord. Ripples on the surface were
illuminated only by a lightbulb or two along a lonely pier. Our thoughts and
bodies oscillated between the heat of the sauna and the coldness of the water.
Bliss set in, nothing else could pierce the fierce tranquility we were wrapped
in. Nothing else could possibly matter. As when the keys kick in, the kick and
snare, and Catharina Stoltenberg’s voice washes over.
