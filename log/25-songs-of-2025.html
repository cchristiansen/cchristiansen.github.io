<h2 id="org3e7205f">25. Debbie Sings – Sunny Skies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e7205f">
<p>
Power poptimists rejoice, with synths this obnoxious there’s no shame left to
lose. Embrace the crucifix of amps, emblaze your crop-top with a font tackier
than <i>brat</i> and get down like it’s 2007 round Ed Banger’s. Debbie Sings, we
party.

<h2 id="org060fc52">24. CHRIST DILLINGER – RIP HULK HOGAN</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org060fc52">
<p>
Sincerity and satire have never been paired so beautifully together before.
Simultaneously grotesque, enthralling and hilarious, Christ Dillinger’s tribute
to self-professed racist and America’s greatest ever wrestler foregrounds
the ugly reality of who our entertainers are.

<h2 id="org65b3c4a">23. Surgeon – Forgotten Gods</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65b3c4a">
<p>
God knows a.m. or is it p.m.? All that matters is the beat, the next beat and
the space compressing and decompressing between. The right combination of
venue, crowd, sound system and track selection allows techno to work its magic
and enrapture its audience. With Forgotten Gods, Surgeon shows that he sure
knows all the conjuring tricks.

<h2 id="orge0dcb4b">22. Roberto Musci – Persistence of Vision</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge0dcb4b">
<p>
The best contemplative pieces offer fertile soundscapes to plant new ideas and
watch them grow. Each listen may sprout vastly different shapes, but the
shadings of light and dark stay the same, providing set twists for thoughts to
navigate, as sounds move us from one space to another. Finely balanced, richly
rewarding.

<h2 id="org4671816">21. Moin – See (featuring Sophia Al-Maria &amp; Ben Vince)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4671816">
<p>
Percussion, repetition, cycles of saxophone, spoken word, repeated, spoken
word, cycles of saxophone, contemplations, again, percussion, contemplate. See?

<h2 id="org0f55fa2">20. Avalon Emerson &amp; the Charm – Eden</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0f55fa2">
<p>
Breezy summers may evoke a certain care-freeness; what worries burden
sun-kissed faces? But long evenings allow old emotions to blow in, linger and
settle. Memories sharpen and resolutions to uphold past promises restore. For
Eden.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7b7acb2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7b7acb2">19. Kathryn Mohr – Horizonless</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7b7acb2">
<p>
It is dark outside already. Dusk is closing in on a dreary day, spent jogging
across wet leaves and wandering Viking graves. Clouds stretch past the
horizons, and beyond. There is a certain serenity to be enjoyed. Crackle of
rain, hiss of wind, the irrefutability of the season.

<div id="outline-container-orge6086d8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge6086d8">18. Haloplus+ – Open Air Backseat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge6086d8">
<p>
The liminal spaces in between our digital and non-digital realities remain
under-explored, though recently a couple of groups in and around Copenhagen
have set down a few poufs in the gaps between CPH and tucked–away Internet
snugs, grabbed a guitar and made themselves at home. These new Enos make Music
for Internet Airports –  and it’s bloody good.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgded9da7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgded9da7">17. Oxis – Long Sardine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgded9da7">
<p>
Oxis may claim there is something fishy at play here. But to the contrary.
Nostalgia is a simple longing for simpler times, evoked here by a simple ditty.
A fleeting wish, which slips away as quickly as it appeared.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org742f99c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org742f99c">16. oqbqbo &amp; Scandinavian Star – Sun Up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org742f99c">
<p>
Terrifying infernos broiling with energy beam their light and brighten our
skies. During the long Scandinavian summer, the brilliance imbues positivity.
Sup Up, chip up – it’s all going to be alright.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org65ae5a9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org65ae5a9">15. Joanne Robertson and Oliver Coates – Gown</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65ae5a9">
<p>
From softly strum guitars, dulcet yet powerful strings and a voice which drifts
and glitters, Joanne Robertson weaves together the most invitingly hearty and
dazzling gown to curl up in and feel the waves of time crashing gently by.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgec3a3e6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgec3a3e6">14. Vanessa Amara – Love won’t love you</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgec3a3e6">
<p>
Each weekend, organs around the world sound to announce the arrival of the
bride and the impending nuptial union. Here, the organs sound a warning, or
perhaps they ruminate on the unidrectionality of love. It’s complicated, either
way.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgee5f13e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgee5f13e">13. RIP Swirl – Let’s Make Out (featuring Ydegirl)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgee5f13e">
<p>
The strains of desire can cripple a budding romantic’s heart by tearing their
inner world this way and that. In momentary swirling flashes though, the
tensions can align and all pull together in the same direction towards one
simple desire. Let’s Make Out is less an invitation, more a crying out for
resolution.

</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf29e445" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf29e445">12. Smerz – You got time and I got money - VVTZJ EDIT (featuring Clairo)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf29e445">
<p>
An instant classic love song reimagined for the ballroom, to slow dance to
under flickering chandeliers. Clairo’s breathy vocals fill the air,
intertwining with the dreamy electric guitar and Smerz’s calm collected
delivery. The effect builds and builds, as powerful as any ballad, before
disappearing away behind thick veils into digital noise.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd325e3f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd325e3f">11. Tyler, The Creator – Mommanem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd325e3f">
<p>
Chest out, feet fleet, Tyler’s ready for a brawling. Run if you can. With Tyler
this livid, singing nursery rhymes about murder, you better pray it wasn’t you
who hurt his feelings. On his momma’nem.
