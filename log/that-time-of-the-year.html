<p>
The signs had been there. The red and green beach balls. The notices from HR.
The upcoming events. The planning, the organisation, the planning the
organisation. My local magpie had told me the other day that the eastern koels
were back, yapping on about their time spent in Queensland – it couldn’t wait
for the koels to go back, if they thought it was so bloody good there. Or
that’s what I imagined the magpie saying, as it squawked in my face on the
balcony causing me to spill my morning eggnog.

It had been coming. This time I was more prepared. I had done the shopping, the
careful filtering out of anything too tacky, too lavish, too unfair, too pink,
too blue, too heavy, too cheap, too expensive, too immoral, too moral, too
passé – a yo-yo and Tamagotchi just don’t cut it anymore. I had done the
shopping, bought appropiately themed wrapping paper, felt both guilty and
proud of the resulting packages, and shipped off the goodies with (hopefully)
ample time. Then there were more trips to the post office to pick up gifts
with cards from faraway relatives and well-wishers. The cards vie with
the flowers for space on top of the piano; the gifts nestle beneath a tree
comprised primarily of cardboard, green felt-tip pen marks and good intentions.

But it arrived today. <i>Oops, I did it again</i> was my most listened to track of
the year, a music streaming service informs me. These were the films I should
have watched, a columnist lets me know. I open a little door to reveal
a drawing of a festive animal in festive attire. I eat a square of chocolate. I
race other programmers to solve a puzzle about calorie-counting elves. Joy to
the world. The silly season is here.
