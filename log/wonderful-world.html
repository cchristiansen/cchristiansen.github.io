<p>
The days were becoming shorter. Summer had been kind to us. Travelling from
loch to loch, broch to broch, Stewart and I spent sunrise to sunset soaking in
the Scottish sun, savouring the sharp contours of the landscape, the briskness,
the too real beauty surrounding us.
</p>

<p>
Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, Brenda Lee sang through our stereo, as we
drove along the long, lonesome roads. It was just the two of us, the vast
sublime vistas, and the sweet sonorous Fifties and Sixties. Stewart would
repeatedly ask for The Bobbettes and I would put on <i>Mr Lee</i>. His fat chubby
face would crinkle with joy and sing along with such glee. How I would flutter.
</p>

<p>
On our walks I told childhood tales of walking across the moor and finding the
perfect song to match the hike, to match my emotions. Stewart would then recall
old comedy routines about Braveheart, about shortbread, offal and heroin.
Occasionally his brow would furrow with a quizzical look.
</p>

<p>
There was a joke he was working on, about the Loch Ness monster. About
conspiracy theories and mistrust of experts. About how despite not having the
requisite knowledge in the relevant subjects, people jumped to such
strongly-held beliefs. But he couldn’t work out the structure, the form. A joke
is delicate, like a song, he explained once. The tiniest bit of inspiration
might be all that it takes. A breeze then blew the lines from his face and he
smiled at me again, and resumed telling me about the local history, the myths
and the Auld Alliance between the Scots and the French.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
… the French I took
</p>

<p>
But I do know that I love you <br />
And I know that if you loved me, too <br />
What a wonderful world this would be
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sam Cooke’s lyrics washed over me as I watched Stewart delight in recalling
treaty details. I’ll show the song to him, I decided. That’s how I’ll let him
know. How I feel. What a wonderful world this would be.
</p>

<p>
Our final stop was Loch Ness. Summer had been kind to us. We sat by the shore,
a few puffy clouds in an ever bluer sky our only companions. I prepared, and
looked Stewart in the eye. My heart whined.
</p>

<p>
‘Stew? I would like to play a song for you.’ I held out an earpiece. His hand
brushed against mine as he placed his earpiece into his ear, and I placed mine
into mine.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Don't know much about history <br />
Don't know much biology <br />
Don't know much about a science book <br />
Don't know much about the French I took
</p>

<p>
But I do know that…
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
‘Yes, YES!’ he leaped.
</p>

<p>
‘I’ve got the joke!’
