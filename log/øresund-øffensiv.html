<p>
The heat hit first. Emanating from the mass of bodies, it clung to our
skin as we dithered along the aisle, looking for free seats in the
cinema-cum-sauna. We found two too near to the screen, draped clean towels over
the burgundy upholstery, sat down and shuffled out of our clothes.
</p>

<p>
‘Good evening folks! Welcome to Ritz Cinemas and our first showing of <i>Nude
Tuesday</i>! As some of you may have already gathered, this is a clothing-optional
showing. If this wasn’t communicated to you beforehand or you are feeling
uncomfortable, please do let me – or one of our helpers here this evening –
know. I’m sure we can get you to a screening of – I don’t know – <i>Top Gun</i> or
something else instead. There will also be other clothing-mandatory times you
can catch this film too – don’t worry.’
</p>

<p>
The MC continued to soothe and explain and clarify and take the edge off of the
jitteriness in the room. After some final words and applause,
the ads began to roll. We held each other’s hands, ecstatic with the novelty.
</p>

<p>
The spoken gibberish is subtitled in English. The acting carries the
story; the subtitles buttress the laughter. A scene of a wife rejecting her
husband’s advances doubles its laughs once we read what her excuse is. When her
mother then gets nosy and tries to help with the situation, the comedy
comes from both the innuendo in gibberish, and its translation. A soaring
sonorous poem by the sex guru played by Jermaine Clement is later rendered
flacid and pathetic in English. The miscommunication, the subtitles, the
gibberish – it’s hilarious.
</p>

<p>
The gibberish is faux-Scandi. Prior to filming, the Kiwi actors had listened
to Icelandic radio for two weeks straight, and attempted to not sound too
French, too Italian, too Greek. The choice of Nordic was astute, not only
because Northern Europeans are notoriously comfortable in the nude, but also
because the Nordic languages have a long history of miscommunication.
</p>

<p>
Norwegians, for example, cannot agree on how to write their language, and have
created <i>riksmål</i>, <i>bokmål</i>, <i>nynorsk</i>, <i>høgnorsk</i> and many other shades of
<i>måls</i> and <i>norsks</i> inbetween. Another example is Cnut, King of Denmark
between 1018 and 1035, whose musings on the tide dumbfounded not only his
contemporaries but has also had historians, linguists and philosophers
scratching their heads for almost a millenium. (Ironically, Cnut’s grandfather
Harald Blåtand, King of Denmark c. 958 – c. 986, is the namesake of the
communications protocol Bluetooth.)
</p>

<p>
The best example of Nordic confusion though stems from Norwegian television.
<i>Uti vår hage</i>, a Norwegian show named after a Swedish folk song, filmed a
documentary of life in Denmark in 2003, revealing how Danes were no longer able
to communicate with one another in Danish. In the footage, a Dane attempts to
buy a new bike tyre, but ends up with a kamelåså instead.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For me, the Danish language has collapsed into meaningless guttural sounds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

hage</div>
</p>

<p>
When the documentary first aired in Denmark, it was wrongly interpreted to be a
spoof and Swedes were wrongly identified to be the culprits. Danish protestors
lined the shore facing Sweden and launched sausages across the strait. Swedes
retaliated with meatballs. The ongoing Øresund Øffensiv remains to be
the major obstacle to Swedish ascession to NATO.
</p>

<p>
After the film and dressed again, my partner and I debriefed over a
fake-herring smörgåsbord and salmon smørresbrød at <i>Feilkommunikasjon</i>.
‘Läcker,’ my partner grinned, savouring the lingonberry jam. ‘I really enjoyed
the film.’
</p>

<p>
‘Me too,’ I agreed.
</p>

<p>
‘The choice of Nordic was particularly apt,’ she expounded, ‘given how
prevalent miscommunication in that region is. Take, for example, the Öresund
Öffensiv, where the Swedes started throwing pannbiff at the Danes. The
Danes retaliated with frikadellen. It all started with a Finnish TV
documentary…’
</p>

<p>
‘Wasn’t it…’ I butt in, but she is having none of it. I stand my ground.
She retaliates, so I throw salmon and she throws herring and covers me in
lingonberry jam but wham what a shot but oh no her towel and we shout at one
another across straits descending into meaningless guttural sounds, gibbering
away.
</p>

<p>
I look at us both, ryebreaded and leverpostejed, and ask, ‘What are we fighting
about again?’
</p>

<p>
She blinks and looks at me. ‘I don’t know – it’s all Greek to me.’
