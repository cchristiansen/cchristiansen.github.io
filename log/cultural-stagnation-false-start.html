<p>
What are the most salient reasons for cultural stagnation? I wish to write an
essay which addresses this. Yet each attempt so far has failed to unburden
itself from the weight of the necessary preamble. Before seeking explanations
for a phenomenon, the phenomenon’s existence should ideally first be
established. Other people’s insistence on the phenomenon does not suffice. (For
the sake of even more thoroughness, before one even embarks on proving the
phenomenon’s existence, one should first argue why the phenomenon at hand is
worthy of discussion.)
</p>

<p>
Establishing that cultural stagnation is happening is a fool’s errand. Culture
is vast, amorphous, multi-dimensional and intangible aside from the artefacts
left in its wake. A measure of culture would have to collate, sort and order
these artefacts – jeans, playlists, reaction videos, fan fiction – and extract
quantitative data from them in a manner which looks about right to the naked
eye, and would yet still suffer from all of the shortcomings of large societal
measures such as GDP. Even if a measure was to show a slowdown in cultural
change, the methodology would have to be dissected. What localities and media
were included? If there is a cultural slowdown in Brooklyn, is that offset by a
boon in Zanzibar? And if rock is dead (or dying or undead), is that because
podcasts are alive? (To use a historical case: though opera zombified after
Wagner, there is no sane claim for a lack of innovation in Western music in the
20th century.)
</p>

<p>
Should the measures still hold and we can confidently say that yes, on the
whole, culture has stagnated, we would then have to wrangle with the implied
aesthetic judgement inherent in the term <i>stagnation</i>. Stagnation is bad, but
is the slowdown of cultural change a necessarily bad thing? Have not previous
periods of cultural stability led to fantastic pieces of art? Must every
decade be as culturally disruptive as the 1960s? Surely some of David Bowie’s
forays (take The Laughing Gnome for example or a good chunk of his works in the
1990s) showcase that there is nothing inherently good with innovation. Some
cultural terrain may be best left undisturbed. Yet even now, though the topic
of whether cultural innovation/stability is good/bad is definitely worthy of
further discussion, we have yet to reach the true question I seek to tackle:
why cultural stagnation? (And potentially, wherefore cultural innovation?)
</p>

<p>
So long as people have compared contemporary art to those of yester years, the
topic of cultural stagnation has never strayed far. Any essay seeking to shine
new light on the topic would first have to acknowledge prior work done,
take stock of each explanation, travel further down roads already mapped out
where required, before striking into the wilderness and forging new paths. And
only now would the fun begin.
