Amongst all the wild and fantastical affairs humans partake in, music is by far
the most baffling. We indoctrinate our infants with lullabies, make pilgrimages
to clubs, festivals and operas, and buy our groceries whilst barely pubescent
teenagers over serenade us over tinny tannoys. There are no clear evolutionary
advantages associated with an appreciation of Bach's fugues or gabber; music is
an inexplicable and joyous byproduct of the human condition.

Since arriving in Australia, <a href="https://fbiradio.com">FBi Radio</a>, the independent non-profit radio station
which plays 50% Australian music (of which 50% is from New South Wales), has
satiated my desire for novel tracks and artists, and helped me to delve into the
local culture and survive a year without the euphoria of dancing with a
hundred fellow revelers. Tkay Maidza, 3NDLES5, Crazymike, Shady Nasty, Low
Flung, Party Dozen, Cool Sounds, &#x2026; (the list is too far too long to properly
compile) - they all immeasurably improved my year.

<p>
With so many great artists and tracks on FBi, I've struggled with having to
visit the website, find the current program, and scroll to locate what's
currently playing everytime my ears are piqued. To solve this, I have created a
<a href="https://github.com/cchristiansen/fbiradio/">Python script</a>. Now I just have to type <code>fbiplaying</code> and the answer falls right
into my lap. Now excuse me - I need to check out what the current track is.
It's wild.

Listen to 94.5 FM.
