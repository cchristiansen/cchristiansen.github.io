<p>
We’d heard the forecast: inclemency on Tuesday evening. A couple hundred
townsfolk gathered outside the local church in anticipation. All of us had
heard rumours of the impending phenomenon. Its might was legendary. Newspaper
clippings from survivors in America warned of incineration, annihilation, and
worse. But despite the evidence of destruction and land laid to waste,
first-hand witnesses gave reverential accounts, fear and awe burned into their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The church doors opened and we filed in, the offer of bread and wine replaced
by ear plugs. We said thanks, but we’d come prepared. The doorman smirked. Red
light bathed the atrium, dimly lighting up a painting at the fore of Christ,
with his arms outstretched, ready to embrace his followers. Ten candles
flickered, patient as uneasiness grew. A church representative took to the
front, clearly delighted by the turn out. What we will witness today… his words
trailed off as his face brightened and morphed and fell as the full weight of
fate became clear to him. He yelped and scurried off, and soon the first
tremors took hold.
</p>

<p>
The phenomenon would be preceded by a separate, milder before-shock, we had
been warned by the forecasts. It thrashed and howled, twisting before us. But
we had seen its like before. No surprise. No fear. Calm settled again. We
half-smiled at each other, complacent.
</p>

<p>
And then it hit. An attack on all sensations. Swirls of cacophony heaped on
cacophony burst apart reason and possibilities of experience. Our bodies rocked
cowed into submission, though our eyes were wide, wild even, desperately
seeking some answer, any answer, any semblance of coherence within this
maelstrom. But the storm continued unrelenting, oblivious to our measly
worries. What perceptions remained simply registered more. Increase. Though it
was more than there had ever been, it was still more. More. Forever revving up.
Then the fear kicked in, it was true, there was only one way out: face the
music. Try to survive.
