New inventions require new terms. 电脑 (diànnăo in Mandarin), literally
electric brain, is the Chinese term for a computer. The Danes tried out
<i>datamat</i>, <i>arbejdsstation</i> and <i>edb-maskine</i> before giving up and just copying
the English. The Koreans, with 컴퓨터 (keompyuteo), and Japanese, with
コンピュータ (konpyūta), did the same. Icelanders went with a bunch of
different terms, including loaning <i>computer</i>, before settling on Sigurður
Nordal’s suggestion <i>tölva</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is representative of Icelandic attempts to maintain an inner consistency
to their language. To a much lesser extent than most other European languages,
Icelandic has seen little change since the initial settlement of Iceland by the
Norse over a thousand years ago. Yes, the Runic alphabet was abandoned in
favour of a Latin-based one, words have been added and faded away from the
lexicon, and pronunciations have drifted. Yet when compared to Iceland’s Norse
cousins on the European mainland, namely Norway, Sweden and Denmark, the drift
has been minuscule. The Scandinavians loaned words from their Hanseatic trading
partners and, due to Napoleon’s forays, even from the French. And though Old
English may be mutually intelligible to Icelanders even today, the English,
with their mongrel language, stand a snowball’s chance in hell in understanding
the tongue of those who roamed Old Blighty a millennium ago.
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate term for this phenomenon is linguistic purity. Foreignness
immediately implies impurity, a tarnishing of what’s right, a sullying. I could
have sworn that I once watched a BBC documentary where some Icelandic scholars
were searching for an alternative term to ‘pure’ in order to discourage
unsavoury tourists (read: white supremacists) from visiting to enjoy an
‘unsullied’ culture. Alas, my bookmarks and Google-fu are failing me.
</p>

<p>
‘White’, for me, evokes many similar feelings of discomfort. I still double
take whenever I read ‘The Whites’, a nickname for Leeds United (after the
colour of their Real Madrid inspired home kit), not a Mosley appreciation
group. Whities, too, which has thankfully since been renamed to AD 93, used to
cause me to squirm – a fantastic music label originally named after the
interplay of ‘YT’ (as the label originated as a Young Turks sub-label, which
itself has since been renamed to Young) with ‘white’ labels (which are records
without accompanying artwork, typically test presses, promos or bootlegs).
</p>

<p>
<i>The White Book</i> by Han Kang, winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature,
translated by Deborah Smith, is suffused with whiteness. Snowflakes, blank
pages, too delicate flowers emerge from Kang’s prose turned poetry. The
sensitivity and preciseness and artfulness are a wonder to behold. Only first
half-way through, when an etymological discussion arises on ‘blank’ vs ‘blanc’,
can the text be accused of being bland.
</p>

<p>
However, an uncomfortable emptiness pervades <i>The White Book</i>. At first, it is
almost imperceptible, a slither missing. Yet as the words flow past, a chasm
emerges, where the words avoid mention. The chasm of grief. For here,
whiteness, above all, denotes not purity nor new beginnings, but the desolation
of a life lived around the contours of a life unlived. No words could describe
the sadness. Yet in <i>The White Book</i>, Han Kang finds them.

<a href="https://thesquareball.net/leeds-united/the-whites-from-a-different-perspective/">A fantastic article</a> by Milan Khara which describes the experience of growing up
as a Leeds United fan during a time when there was ‘increasingly open racism on
display’.
</p>

<p>
Nic Tasker <a href="https://ra.co/news/72819">explains</a> the change of name from Whities to AD 93.
</p>

<p>
A personal favourite of mine of AD 93’s output is Whities 006 by Avalon
Emerson, perhaps the best DJ I have ever seen perform.

My copy of the The White Book was gifted to me by Georgie and Dan. Thank you.
