Coding is difficult. Communicating a set of instructions to an overly pedantic
machine and dealing with the aftermath – the misplaced comma, the fallacies in
your logic, the unplugged cable, the pervasive self-doubt – is nobody’s
idea of easy. But coding is also fun. The ability to communicate a set of
instructions to a machine, which will execute precisely what you have
instructed, and to see the exact product of your thought, is intensely
gratifying.

The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure

exertion of the imagination. […] One types the correct incantation on a
keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were
nor could be.

<p>
A licence sets the terms and conditions of how others may interact with your
thought-stuff. May they look at it? Touch it? Prod it? May they play with it?
Adapt it to their own needs? Make money with it? And if they improve it, do
they have to share those improvements with you?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-proprietary" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="proprietary">The legal default: proprietary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-proprietary">
<p>
As with all copyright, by default, anything you create belongs to you. If you
write code, nobody else may use it, play with it, sniff it. This evidently
sucks. The first hackers<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> flagrantly disregarded these limitations:
they stayed up all night sharing ideas, code, thoughts, theories, computing
time, and sweet-and-sour bitter melon. Military sponsors (who are accustomed to
secrecy) understandably baulked, as did those who were primarily interested in
money. (The future richest person in the world, Bill Gates, denounced this
culture of sharing in An Open Letter to Hobbyists, denouncing hobbyists as
thieves.) Software should be closed and locked away. Software should be
proprietary. Sharing and caring be damned.
</p>

<p>
As a reaction against closed software, hackers gathered to defend their culture
of openness and sharing, and created an alternative: free and open source
software.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-free-software" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="free-software">Free (as in freedom) software</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-software">
<p>
Free and open source software<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> licences allow users to share, to play
with, to modify, to monetise code. Free and open source software powers the 100
fastest supercomputers, roves on Mars and underpins the Internet. Amazon,
Microsoft, Meta (Facebook) and Alphabet (Google), all fervent users of free and
open source software, made a combined gross profit of over $600 billion
in 2022.
</p>

<p>
Free and open source software licences come in two flavours: permissive and
copyleft. Permissive says: do whatever the hell you want to do with
it. Copyleft says: do whatever the hell you want to do with it, but allow
others to do whatever the hell they want to do with it too.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-permissive" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="permissive">Permissive</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-permissive">
<p>
GitHub, bought by Microsoft in 2018, is the world’s largest host of free and
open source software. Developers gather to share code, ideas, issues and fixes.
It is the first port of call for developers to start a new project, and the
overwhelming number of projects use a permissive licence.
</p>

<p>
Why? The owner, Microsoft, uses MIT, a permissive licence. Other big players –
Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook – use permissive licences too. They benefit
from inculcating a culture of permissive licences, as it allows them to reap
the benefits of using volunteers’ code, having volunteers fix their bugs and
write new features, and to simply close off access when it suits them. Copyleft
is viral<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>, GitHub tells us. Copyleft is a cancer<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>, the
previous CEO of Microsoft stated. Copyleft scares users off from using the
code, is what is heavily implied and believed. Is that so?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-copyleft" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="copyleft">Copyleft</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-copyleft">
<p>
Copyleft stipulates that our freedoms are non-negotiable. You have the right to
use my software, to modify it, to share it. But if you share it, you must grant
the person you share the software with those same freedoms: they too must be
allowed to use the software, to modify it, to share it. You are unable to
restrict those freedoms in any way.
</p>

<p>
Copyleft is so simple, so idealistic, so compelling, it seems impossible that
it could work. Detractors have probed for loopholes, to find a fault in the
logic. Would I be able to charge the other person? How about if so much of the
ship changed, every part is new, is the ship still copyleft? Do I still have to
provide those freedoms if an emu is chasing me? What about on a Tuesday?
</p>

<p>
To soothe all of these fears and block up any cracks, the best copyleft
licence, the GNU AGPL, runs to 5535 words. Still though, questions come, and
all-encompassing statements: No one could make money off of it. No company
would dare touch it. Nothing so morally naïve could survive in the ‘real’
world. Take your head out of the clouds, clear your mind of ‘thought-stuff’,
this ain’t gonna work.
</p>

<p>
Yet, copyleft powers the 100 fastest supercomputers, roves on Mars and
underpins the Internet. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta (Facebook) and Alphabet
(Google), all heavy users of copyleft software, made a combined gross profit of
over $600 billion in 2022. Copyleft can succeed. Copyleft has succeeded.
</p>

<p>
The case for copyleft is clear. Coding is difficult, but we can share the
burden. Let us share the fun too.

As in any other sphere with heated ideological hair-splitting, there
are many terms used to describe essentially the same concept. Free software,
the original term, is favoured by idealists. Open source was created by
pragmatists who were worried that the term free was being misunderstood and was
scaring off businesses. Open source is now the most commonly used term. Free
and open source software, a lengthy and unwieldy compromise, is preferred by
those who adopt pretensions of idealism, but are too cowardly to fully commit.
Other alternatives, such as free libre and open source software (FLOSS), have
even more obvious flaws.
