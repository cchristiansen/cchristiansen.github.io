<center><h1>First commit to KDE</h1></center>

<p>After years of reading Linux Format, then Linux Voice, now finding refuge
in <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/">Late Night Linux</a>; after scouring 
through countless forums over a decade ago to ornate my desktop with ever 
fancier bling (and wobblier windows); after wrecking multiple installations 
from ever more ridiculous projects (who knew that running state-of-the-art 
games through Wine on a tiny Sony Vaio laptop without a GPU wasn't a sensible 
idea?), I have finally contributed back to the open source community.
</p>

<p>I stumbled across a recommendation to read the excellent 
<a href="https://producingoss.com">Producing Open Source Software</a> by Karl 
Fogel.
The book demystified the inner workings of open source, and had me itching to
join in. So I set about on a mission to do so.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Hang out on IRC.</h2> 
<p>See what's happening.
To be honest, I couldn't see much happening on IRC, but I quickly became 
frustrated by Konversation's inability to log my nickname in automatically.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Find out what the issue was.</h2> 
<p>Apparently NickServ is no
longer the go-to identification service and I should have been using SASL
instead. <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400362">Why wasn't that
the default?</a> Nobody was able to say - everybody seemed to think it was a 
sensible idea. Time to get stuck in.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Get the build environment running.</h2>
<p>This was a real pain, despite KDE's 
<a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development">impeccable wiki
</a> to help get started. Although LTS releases are
incredibly useful for a multitude of reasons, I found out the hard way 
that they're ill-suited for development.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Change the code.</h2> 
<p>And test, test, test. Diving into new territory always contains several
unforeseen pitfalls. However, I soon had something working, and sent it off 
to review. Again, KDE has 
<a href="https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Phabricator">excellent
documentation</a> for newcomers. After a minor edit...</p>

<h2>Step 5: Celebrate.</h2> 
<p>It got accepted! Woohoo! Champagne for everyone¹!</p>
<p>Ah wait, somebody on the #konversation channel has found another annoying 
bug... Hold my flute.</p>
