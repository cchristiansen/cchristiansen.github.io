<h1 class="title">Wellness Productivity</h1>
<p>
While following the scent of some sparkly stones, I have become trapped by
wall-high posters, shiny DVD cases; cursive, serif and sans-serif types
string me to an unseen ball and chain, dangling my prospects afore a row of
bared lips, which strain to contain the overflowing bleached whites within. One
by one the infinite smiles approach me. A clean bugle call precedes each
hovering mouth, ‘Please give a [Most Well And Distinguished Welcome] to our
[Honorable And High Distinguished Knowledger] on the [Affairs Of Life Of Humans
And Similar],’ joined in chorus by ethereal recommendations stemming from
unlocatable institutes and growth centres.
</p>

<p>
‘If only I had heard from [] earlier, I may have never have had any issues with
my organic coffee cupholder.’
</p>

<p>
‘[] lays bare the secrets of the universe and more, and strips back the veil
from nature and beyond, and denudes the mist from everything itself and etc.’
</p>

<p>
‘I have bought multiple copies of []’s [], in order to digest the insights not
only aurally and visually, but nasally too. Listen, read and snort yourself to
enlightenment. Bless you.’
</p>

<p>
The oncoming grin is accompanied by some other feature: a loose-fitting shirt,
a size-too-small skirt, a tie with both stripes and dots on of course to
indicate personality. Floating above sit the two same, dead eyes, boring into
my self-worth, mining me for nuggets to melt and fashion into a bangle, a nose
piercing, a monogrammed button, to adorn my latest life guide.
</p>

<p>
‘Good Life, Dear Listener/Reader/Other Consumption Methoder. I am
Professor/Most Distinguished/Reviled By None/Envy Of The Mongeese
Smithy/Dharma/Valhallalala, Student/Learner of the Path/Road/Seaway to The
End/Wisdom/Valhallalala. I bring you gifts of Gold Standard Lessons in
Self/Unself/All-selves/Only-elves Respect and myrrh. I will Teach How to
Approach Your Journey, and Baby, You have just Started.’ A gush of canned
uplift muzak plays, and the learnings commence. Different smiles espouse
different aphorisms.
</p>

<p>
‘Give me a Buddha, and I will give you a quote.’
</p>

<p>
‘The way to Live Laugh Love, is to Shift Shaft Shove.’
</p>

<p>
‘I am the walrus, goo-goo g’joob, g’goo goo g’joob, goo goo g’joob [copyright,
the Beatles].’
</p>

<p>
But every philosophy comes coated with the same layers upon layers of
justification. Not only do ceaseless recommendations riddle the
poster/book/DVD/other medium at hand, but validation from
history/tradition/science/religion (but only The Bible, Greek mythology and
Buddhism, maybe a sprinkling of Tao, and a quote from Gandhi of course) is also
hauled out, to tenuously brace the argument that there are 109 Methods to
Betterment Wellness Productivity.
</p>

<p>
I splutter. The fumes of mouthwash emanating from the parade of incisors brews
with smothering incense and the hanging musk of a spiritual gathering in my
nostrils; my body shuts. ‘Help!’ I shout. ‘Help me!’ More and more mouths spout
advice, more and more quirkily patterned cravats press forward to prescribe me
their experiences. Self-help books eagerly flap and wink their pages at me,
podcasters and influencers cast their lashes towards me. ‘Help me. Help,’ I
whimper. A friend answers. ‘What’s up buddy? Talk to me.’ And I do.
