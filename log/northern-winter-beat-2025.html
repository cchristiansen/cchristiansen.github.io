For three evenings in February, Aalborg plays host to Northern Winter Beat, a
music festival set to defrost and challenge its audience.

The 2025 edition began with a performance from <b>Lubomyr Melnyk</b>, a Ukrainian
pianist, at Budolfi Church, Aalborg’s grandest building. Over six centuries
worth of architecture and extravagant decoration set the stage to be graced by
a scruffy Melnyk, who lamented the advent of plastic listening devices,
extolled the virtues of listening live or on wooden speakers, and, ‘Maybe the
hippies were right. I’m not a hippy, at least no longer. Even though… I just
don’t have time to deal with my beard or – Oh no, I was supposed to have
brushed my hair,’ he tailed away before offering us a beautiful mandala. His
notes painted the finest Monet, each key press a ripple in a lily pond, a
reflection of the mangroves above, as numerous as raindrops in a passing
shower, each as delicate as a leaf’s rustle. His hands danced with impossible
technique. Debussy and Gould sprung to mind, but this was truly a maximalist’s
vision of Glass, Reich and Riley. What have the minimalists wrought? A warning
of the evils of Spotify preceded his following piece, Butterfly, where he
played a duet with a recording of himself. If the mandala acted as a testament
to his technicality, Butterfly confirmed his intense musicality. Melodies
sprung from the shifting harmonic undergrowth, as radiant as new blooming
petals, before wilting away into the high ceilings and crypts below. Third and
finally, Melnyk introduced a piece to acknowledge the bravery of Ukrainians. He
spoke on Putin and Putin’s hate of Ukrainians, for ‘they are the only ones who
can truly see the darkness of the Russian’s soul.’ The piece began with a ghost
haunting the speakers. Mid-range feedback howled persistently, fading away only
to return.
</p>

<p>
A stone throw’s away at Studenterhuset Café, <b>Lars Bech Pilgaard</b> took a violin
bow to a guitar, and with it dared us to leave. Plenty did. His second piece
exhibited more recognisable forms of technique, demonstrating an evident
talent, which was gleefully wielded in pursuit of novelty instead of, say,
harmony or melody or rhythm. ‘Imagine a bagpipe – or don’t,’ he suggested prior
to a piece which was more reminiscent of Lightning Bolt without the drums.
Whilst picking up a banjo for his next piece, he attempted to advertise his
wares, before realising his folly. As he played, he mumbled and grumbled,
completely enraptured by the soundscape he concocted, animated with eyes closed
by the interplay of string against string, his body wracked around his
instrument. At the end, he thanked us for sticking it out with him. I bought a
record.
</p>

<p>
Another soloist closed out the Thursday at Studenterhuset Hall. <b>Zola Jesus</b>
played a grand piano which inexplicably had its top faced towards the back of
the stage instead of the audience. Following Pilgaard, the mere presence of
song and structure seemed shocking. Her voice was the real star, the piano
acted simply as a placeholder for an imagined orchestra. Jesus, too, was
wrapped up in her own world, though on occasion she would remember the
crowd, and engage with us with almost comical zeal. But the microphone was
too close and the piano chords too plain. Thursday night’s a school night;
we left early.

Utzon Center, the final building to be realised by Jørn Utzon, famed architect
of the Sydney Opera House, sits on the bank of the Limfjord, its
characteristically wave-like ceilings greet the passing sound. <b>Virta</b>, a trio
of drummer, guitarist and trumpeter/digital miscellaneaist/wailing Finn, took
to the stage, the windows behind providing a panorama of the Limfjord and
Nørresundby. The three of them sculpted sound which expanded gradually as
interlocking crescendos coalesced, iridescent streaks emerged as the air grew
thicker. The drummer was blatantly very good. So good I wished to see the band
sabotage their own rhythms, yet the operation remained slick. A smiley lead
thanked us profusely between each song. A good start to the Friday schedule,
they proved to be the highlight of the day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Naima Bock</b> and an accompanying quartet were already well under way by the
time we had hurried to Vor Frelsers church. The candle-lit and warm interior, a
stark contrast to the winter conditions outside, lulled us. The music, too,
comforted like soup. Only a couple of false starts roused us from our drowsy
state. Bock mentioned that she had chosen more subdued songs, to match the
setting. Funny, given that the last musical act we’d seen perform here was
Swans.
</p>

<p>
Headline act Diana Barkot of Pussy Riot performed next, but I took a chance on
<b>Snapped Ankles</b> instead. A certain lairiness was purring through the room at
Huset when I arrived, the nordjysk crowd itching for a good time. The synth
beat provided cover for nods around the room, signalling intent. A trio of
London lads dressed head-to-toe in camourflage gone silly sensed the hype and
took to the mic. Alas, the drum machine never kicked in, the amp having caught
flu on the flight over, according to the lead lad. ‘Fuck Spotify, for giving
the amp flu,’ he then proclaimed, stroking his camo beard, whilst tech lad
troubleshooted and lad-in-waiting giggled, ‘It can’t get any worse.’ The crowd
trickled out and searched elsewhere, as each stop-start deflated our hopes of a
party ever kicking off.
</p>

<p>
I still wanted to see Diana Burkot, and was excited to see her perform with
<b>New Age Doom</b>, based off of my cursory pre-festival research. (According to my
spies, Diana Burkot​’s solo show delivered a powerful message, however, what
the message was remained unclear.) A solitary Greg Valou appeared at
Studenterhuset Hall, apologised for a lack of a drummer, announced a set of
mostly drone music with a sprinkling of field recordings and vocal tracks. No
Pussy Riot in sight. Valou, too, took a violin bow to his guitar, but his use
was less an exploration of form than Pilgaard, more an application of technique
to layer texture upon more texture, blanketting us with excessive tog. With no
rhythm or rhyme to mark undulations in time, a monotone set in. Though the
field recordings added splashes of colour and Scratch’s voice will live
forever, neither could stave off the disappointment of expectations left
unfulfilled. (In contrast, my partner, who went to see Buzz’ Ayaz instead, was
bouncing from the walls with band tee and record in hand when she got home.)

Gråbrødrekloster Museet has one of the coolest entrances to a museum. Its
doorway hides in plain sight in the heart of Aalborg, right in front of
Salling, the city’s busiest department store. Few notice the grey-robed monks
adorning the standalone lift to the skeletons below. Forty-five minutes prior
to a gig capped at 35, a gaggle of us were handed yellow tickets with
instructions to meet later. When the time came, a man summoned us, took us
through another entrance, offered us a shot of dubious liquor and we
entered to see <b>Elias Rønnenfelt</b> bundled around his guitar. With
characteristic nonchalance he threw himself into song, and against the glass
panes guarding the museum’s treasures, setting off the alarms outside. His
acoustic set included some Iceage tracks, a brilliant rendition of Calenture
from his Marching Church project, plus a couple of requests at the end.
Stripped to just himself and a guitar, Rønnenfelt’s talent for guitar-playing
came to the fore, his songwriting already undeniable. I would have gladly
listened to his entire discography (lucre, Vår, To The Comrades/Jackie,
Dragged, even the atrocious Silent Night karaoke) multiple times repeated,
however after 30 minutes it was all over. He invited us to join him later.
</p>

<p>
At Huset, <b>Fitnesss</b> terrorised us. Time, sound, space, light and mind became
fluid. It was some neo-fucking-pagan shit. Words are inadequate. Awe-inducing.
I left early.
</p>

<p>
<b>Elias Rønnenfelt</b> was on stage again, this time at Utzon Center flanked by a
bassist and a drummer, stand-ins for Lola Hammerich of Baby In Vain (see last
year’s <a href="./northern-winter-beat-2024.html">review</a>) and Tobias Laust. With the backing of a band, the songs were
more fully realised than his solo set earlier. Heavy Glory and lucre featured
heavily this time, with a short foray into Throughout The Borders. The
collaborations with Dean Blunt sounded tantalisingly short; fragile songs like
Soldier Song were carried by Rønnenfelt’s magnetism; Sound of Confusion proved
that even without Iceage, Rønnenfelt can brew up a hell of a storm. A man old
enough to know better started swaying and propped himself against the stand
holding up a speaker, his festivities having already got the better of him,
taking all those within his vicinity out of the moment, as the fear of timber
loomed large. After too long a while, the drunk took himself away, and we were
able to enjoy a beautiful solo rendition of Against The Moon, undisturbed by
one of Pieter Bruegel’s bacchanalists.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mermaid Chunky</b> were in full swing by the time we arrived at Huset. The
A-level art project gone overboard consisted of a duo in ridiculous outfits
singing ridiculous songs in front of a visual art projection which may have
been a video but I suspect to be an over-elaborate gigabyte-sized PowerPoint
presentation. 2k era aesthetics gone 4k – roll over Superorganism, this is the
sound of the Internet. When drip drip drop Mermaid Chunky broke into Little
April Shower, my partner went wild. The crowd danced and pranced. Near the end,
Mermaid Chunky asked giddily, ‘Can we get some dry ice in here please? The
previous act was crazy, you couldn’t see anything. It was mad, there was a man
crawling on the floor. We’ll pay.’
</p>

<p>
Eleven performances deep, we reconvened at Studenterhuset Café for the last
act. Our spies reported back that Kanaan were good and Dungen too, and bemoaned
various bodily ailments. A four-armed blunt-smoking-frog-caped
rat-god-worshipper rushed on stage, told us all that Northern Europeans are
perceived as cold in Colombia (to which an audience member replied, ‘we are!’)
and then said how that we were actually all really rather nice. <b>Julián
Mayorga</b> then began a tale about a dog which had been left rotting on the
roadside, and how Jesus – this is a true story – walked past, disgusted and
confused by it, and the experience of all of this from the perspective of the
dead dog, in the form of song. Fun ensued, sore backs be damned. Chak chak chak
chak confetti!
