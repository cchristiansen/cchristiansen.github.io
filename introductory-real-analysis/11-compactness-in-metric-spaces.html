<b>Definition</b>
Let \(R\) be a metric space and \(\epsilon\) any positive number. Then a set
\(A \subseteq R\) is said to be an \(\epsilon\)​<i>-net</i> for a set \(M \subseteq R\) if,
for every \(x \in M\) there is at least one point \(a \in A\) such that
\(\rho(x, a) \leq \epsilon\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
Given a metric space \(R\) and a subset \(M \subseteq R\), suppose \(M\) has a
<i>finite</i> \(\epsilon\)​-net for every \(\epsilon > 0\). Then \(M\) is said to be
<i>totally bounded</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>
Example 5 shows that the Hilbert cube (or fundamental parallelepiped) is an
infinite-dimensional totally bounded set.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org39c6c17">
<p>
Every countably compact metric space \(R\) is totally bounded.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgd1ca419">
<p>
Suppose \(R\) is not totally bounded, then there is an \(\epsilon_0 > 0\) such that
\(R\) has no finite \(\epsilon_0\)​-net. Choose any point \(a_1 \in R\). Then \(R\)
contains at least one point, say \(a_2\), such that \(\rho(a_1, a_2) >
\epsilon_0\), since otherwise \(a_1\) would be an \(\epsilon_0\)​-net for \(R\).
Moreover, \(R\) contains a point \(a_3\) such that \(\rho(a_1, a_3) > \epsilon_0\),
\(\rho(a_2, a_3) > \epsilon_0\), since otherwise the pair \(a_1, a_2\)
would be an \(\epsilon_0\)​-net for \(R\). More generally, once having found the
points \(a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n\), we choose \(a_{n+1} \in R\) such that
\(\rho(a_k, a_{n+1}) > \epsilon_0 \quad (k = 1, 2, \ldots, n)\). This
construction gives an infinite sequence of distinct points
\(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, \ldots\) with no limit points, since
\(\rho(a_j, a_k) > \epsilon_0\) if
\(j \neq k\). But then \(R\) cannot be countably compact.

<b>Corollary 1</b>

Every countably compact metric space has a countable everywhere dense subset

<p>
Since \(R\) is totally bounded, by Theorem 1, \(R\) has a finite \((1/n)\)​-net for
every \(n=1, 2, \ldots\). The union of all these nets is then a countably
everywhere dense subset of \(R\). It follows from Theorem 5
<a href="./09-topological-spaces-basic-concepts.html">Topological Spaces: Basic Concepts</a> that \(R\) has a countable base.

<p>
<b>Remark</b>
Total boundedness is not sufficient for a metric space to be compact. The set
of rational points in the interval \([0, 1]\) forms a metric space \(R\) which is
totally bounded but not compact.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orge3306c6">
<p>
A metric space \(R\) is compact if and only if it is totally bounded and compact.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org0a42ff9">
<p>
To see that compactness of \(R\) implies completeness of \(R\), we need only note
that if \(R\) has a Cauchy sequence \(\{x_n\}\) with no limit, then \(\{x_n\}\) has
no limit point in \(R\). Hence if \(R\) is compact, \(R\) is complete. By Theorem 1,
if \(R\) is complete, \(R\) is totally bounded.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, suppose \(R\) is totally bounded and complete, and let \(\{x_n\}\) be
any infinite sequence of distinct points in \(R\). Let \(N_1\) be a finite \(1\)​-net
for \(R\), and construct a closed sphere of radius 1 about every point of \(N_1\).
Since these spheres cover \(R\) and there are infinitely many of them, at least
one of the spheres, say \(S_1\), contains an infinite subsequence
\[x_1^{(1)}, \ldots, x_n^{(1)}, \ldots\]
of the sequence \(\{x_n\}\). Let \(N_2\) be a finite \(1/2\)​-net for \(R\), and
construct a closed sphered of \(1/2\) for every point of \(N_2\). Then at least one
of these spheres, say \(S_2\), contains an infinite subsequence
\[x_1^{(2)}, \ldots, x_n^{(2)}, \ldots\]
of the sequence \(\{x_n^{(1)\}\). Continue this construction indefinitely,
where \(S_n\) has radius \(1/2^{n-1}\). Let \({S’}_n\) be the closed sphere with the
same centre as \(S_n\) but with a radius \(r_n\) twice as large (i.e., equal to
\(1/2^n\)). Then clearly
\[{S’}_1 \subseteq {S’}_2 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq {S’}_n \subseteq \ldots,\]
and moreover \(r_n \rightarrow 0\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\). Since \(R\) is
complete, it follows from the nested sphere theorem (Theorem 2, <a href="./07-complete-metric-spaces.html">Complete Metric Spaces</a>) that
\[\cap_{n=1}^\infty {S’}_n \neq \emptyset.\]
In fact, there is a point \(x_0 \in R\) such that
\[\cap_{n=1}^\infty {S’}_n = \{x_0\}\]
(recall Problem 3, <a href="./07-complete-metric-spaces.html">Complete Metric Spaces</a>). Clearly \(x_0\) is a limit point of
the original sequence \(\{x_n\}\), since every neighbourhood of \(x_0\) contains
some sphere \(S_k\) and hence some infinite subsequence \(\{x_n^{(k)}\}\).
Therefore every infinite sequence \(\{x_n\}\) of distinct points of \(R\) has a
limit point of \(R\). It follows that \(R\) is countably compact and hence compact,
by Corollary 2.

<b>Definition</b>
A family \(\Phi\) of functions \(\phi\) defined on a closed interval \([a, b]\) is

<b>Definition</b>
A family \(\Phi\) of functions \(\phi\) defined a closed interval \([a, b]\) is said

\(|\phi(x’) - \phi(x’’)| < \epsilon\) for all \(x’, x’’ \in [a, b]\) and all
\(\phi \in \Phi\).

<p>
<b>Theorem 4 (Arzelà)</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgc4ab9c5">
<p>
A necessary and sufficient condition for a family \(\Phi\) of continuous
functions \(\phi\) defined on a closed interval \([a, b]\) to be relatively compact
in \(C_{[a, b]}\) is that \(\Phi\) be uniformly bounded and continuous.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org9c42322">
<p>
We first prove necessity and then sufficiency.
</p>

<p>
(Necessity.) Suppose \(\Phi\) is relatively compact in \(C_{[a, b]}\). Then by
Theorem 3, it is totally bounded, so given any \(\epsilon > 0\), there is a
finite \((\epsilon/3)\)​-net \(\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n\) in \(\Phi\) (see Problem 1).
Being a continuous function defined on a closed interval, each \(\phi_i\) is
bounded:
\[|\phi_i(x)| \leq K \quad (a \leq x \leq b).\]
Let \(K = \max\{K_1, \ldots, K_n\} + \epsilon/3\). By the definition of an
\((\epsilon/3)\)​-net, given any \(\phi \in \Phi\), there is at least one \(\phi_i\)
such that
\[\rho(\phi, \phi_i) = \max_{a \leq x \leq b} |\phi(x) = \phi_i(x)| \leq
\epsilon/3.\]
Therefore \(|\phi(x)| \leq |\phi_i(x)| + \epsilon/3 \leq K_i + \epsilon/3 \leq
K\), i.e. \(\Phi\) is uniformly bounded. Moreover, each function \(\phi_i\) in the
\((\epsilon/3)\)​-net is continuous, and hence uniformly continuous, on \([a, b]\).
Hence, given any \(\epsilon > 0\), there is a \(\delta_i\) such that
\[|\phi_i(x_1) - \phi_i(x_2)| \leq \epsilon/3\]
whenever \(|x_1-x_2| < \delta_i\).
Let \(\delta = \min\{\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_n\}\). Then, given any
\(\phi \in \Phi\) and choosing \(\phi_i\) such that \(\rho(\phi, \phi_i) <
\epsilon/3\), we have
\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split} |\phi(x_1) - \phi(x_2)| &\leq |\phi(x_1) -
\phi_i(x_1) + |\phi_i(x_1) - \phi_i(x_2)| + |\phi_i(x_2) - \phi(x_2)| \\
& < \epsilon/3 + \epsilon/3 + \epsilon/3 = \epsilon
\end{split}\end{equation}\]
whenever \(|x_1 - x_2| < \delta\). This proves the equicontinuity of \(\Phi\).
</p>

<p>
(Sufficiency.) Suppose \(\Phi\) is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. Accordin
to Theorem 3, to prove that \(\Phi\) is relatively compact in \(C_{[a, b]}\), we
need only show that \(\Phi\) is totally bounded, i.e., that given any \(\epsilon >
0\), there exists a finite \(\epsilon\)​-net for \(\Phi\) in \(C_{[a, b]}\). Since
\(\Phi\) is uniformly bounded, \(|\phi(x)| \leq K\) for all \(\phi \in \Phi\), and by
equicontinuity, let \(\delta > 0\) be such that
\[|\phi(x_1) - \phi(x_2)| < \epsilon/5\]
for all \(\phi \in \Phi\) whenever \(|x_1-x_2|< \delta\). Divide the interval \(a
\leq x \leq b\) along the x-axis into subintervals of length less than
\(\delta\), by introducing points of subdivision \(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n\) such
that
\[a = x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_n = b\]
and then draw a vertical line through each of these points. Similarly, divide
the interval \(-K \leq y \leq K\) along the y-axis into subintervals of length
less than \(\epsilon/5\), by introducing points of subdivision
\(y_0, y_1, \ldots, y_m\) such that
\[-K = y_0 < y_1 < \ldots < y_m= K\]
and then draw a horizontal line through each of these points. In this way, the
rectangle \(a < x < b\), \(-K < y < K\) is divided into \(nm\) cells of horizontal
side length less than \(\delta\) and vertical side length less than \(\epsilon/5\).
</p>

<p>
We now associate with each function \(\phi \in \Phi\) a polygonal line
\(y = \psi(x)\) which has vertices at points of the form \((x_k, y_l)\) and differs
from the function \(\phi\) by less than \(\epsilon/5\) at every point \(x_k\) (the
reader should draw a figure and convince themself on the existence of such a
function).
</p>

<p>
Since
\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split} |\phi(x_k) - \psi(x_k)| &\leq \epsilon/5, \\
​|\phi(x_{k+1}) - \psi(x_{k+1})| &\leq \epsilon/5, \\
​|\phi(x_k) - \phi(x_{k+1})| &\leq \epsilon/5,
\end{split}\end{equation}\]
by construction, we have
\[|\psi(x_k) - \psi(x_{k+1})| \leq 3\epsilon/5.\]
Moreover,
\[|\psi(x_k) - \psi(x)| \leq 3\epsilon/5 \quad (x_k \leq x \leq x_{k+1}),\]
since \(\psi(x)\) is linear between the point \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+1}\). Let \(x\) be any
point in \([a, b]\) and \(x_k\) the point of subdivision nearest to \(x\) on the
left. Then
\[|\phi(x)-\psi(x)|
\leq |\phi(x)-\phi(x_k)| + |\phi(x_k)-\psi(x_k)| + |\psi(x_k)-\psi(x)|
< \epsilon,\]
i.e. the set of polygonal lines \(\psi(x)\) forms an \(\epsilon\)​-net for \(\Phi\).
But there are obviously only finitely many such lines. Therefore \(\Phi\) is
totally bounded.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5 (Peano)</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org06b330d">
<p>
Let \(f(x, y)\) be defined and continuous on a plane domain \(G\). Then at least
one integral curve of the differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)\)
passes through each point \((x_0, y_0)\) of \(G\).
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof" id="orgb047918">
<p>
By the continuity of \(f\), we have \(|f(x, y)| \leq K\) in some domain
\(G’ \subseteq G\) containing the point \((x_0, y_0)\). Draw the lines with slopes
\(K\) and \(-K\) through the point \((x_0, y_0)\). Then draw vertical lines \(x = a\)
and \(x=b \quad (a < x_0 < b\)  which together with the first two lines form two
isosceles triangles contained in \(G’\) with common vertex \((x_0, y_0)\), as shown
in the diagram. (TODO INCLUDE DIAGRAM.) This gives a closed interval \([a, b]\),
which will figure in the rest of the proof.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to construct a family of polygonal lines, called
<i>Euler lines</i>, associated with the differential equation
\(\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)\).
We begin by drawying the line with slope \(f(x_0, y_0)\) through the point
\((x_0, y_0)\). Next, choosing a point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the first line, we draw
the line \(f(x_1, y_1)\) through the point \((x_1, y_1)\). Then, choosing a point
\((x_2, y_2)\) on the second line, we draw the line with slope \(f(x_2, y_2)\)
through the point \((x_2, y_2)\), and so on indefinitely. SUppose we construct a
whole sequence \(L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_n, \ldots\) of such Euler lines going
through the point \((x_0, y_0)\), with the property that the length of the
longest line segment making up \(L_n\) approaches \(0\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\).
Let \(\phi_n\) be the function with graph \(L_n\). Then this gives a family of
functions \(\phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots, \phi_n, \ldots\), all defined on the interval
\([a, b]\), which is easily seen to be uniformly bounded and equicontinuous (as
they are bounded by \(K\) and are straight lines). It follows from Arzelà’s
theorem that the sequence \(\{\phi_n\}\) is relatively compact and therefore
conatains a uniformly convergent subsequence
\[\phi^{(1)}, \phi^{(2)}, \ldots, \phi^{(n)}, \ldots.\]
Let \(\phi(x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \phi^{(n)}(x)\). Then clearly
\(\phi(x_0) = y_0\), so that the curve \(y = \phi(x)\) passes through the point
\((x_0, y_0)\). We now show that the \(y = \phi(x)\) satisfies the differential
equation \(\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)\) in the open interval \((a, b)\). This means
showing that, given any \(\epsilon > 0\) and any points \(x’, x’’ \in (a, b)\), we
have
\[|\frac{\phi(x’’) - \phi(x’)}{x’’ - x’} - f(x’, \phi(x’))| < \epsilon\]
whenever \(|x’’ - x’|\) is sufficiently small, or equivalently that
\[|\frac{\phi^{(n)}(x’’) - \phi^{(n)}(x’)}{x’’-x’} - f(x’, \phi^{(n)}(x’))|
< \epsilon\]
whenever \(n\) is sufficiently large and \(|x’’ - x’|\) is sufficiently small. Let
\(y’ = \phi(x’)\). Then, by continuity of \(f\), given any \(\epsilon > 0\), there is
a number \(\eta > 0\) such that
\[f(x’, y’) - \epsilon < f(x, y) < f(x’, y’) + \epsilon\]
whenever \(|x - x’| < 2\eta\), \(|y-y’| < 4K\eta\).
The set of points \((x, y)\) satisfying these inequalities is a rectange which we
denote by \(Q\). Let \(N\) be so large that for all \(n > N\), the length of the
longest segment making up \(L_n\) is less than \(\eta\) and moreover
\[|\phi(x) - \phi^{(n)}(x)| < K\eta.\]
Then all the Euler lines \(L_n\) with \(n > N\) live inside the rectange \(Q\)
(why?). Suppose \(L_n\) has vertices
\((a_0, b_0), (a_1, b_1), \ldots, (a_{k+1}, b_{k+1})\),
where \(a \leq x’ < a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k < x’’ \leq a_{k+1}\).
[Note we assume that \(x’’ > x’\). The case \(x’’ < x’\) is treated similarly.]
Then
\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split} \phi^{(n)}(a_1) - \phi^{(n)}(x’) & = f(a_0, b_0)(a_1 - x’), \\
\phi^{(n)}(a_{i+1}) - \phi^{(n)}(a_i) & = f(a_i, b_i)(a_{i+1} - a_i) \quad
(i = 1, 2, \ldots, k-1), \\
\phi^{(n)}(x’’) - \phi^{(n)}(a_k) & = f(a_k, b_k)(a’’ - a_k).
\end{split}\end{equation}\]
Hence, if \(|x’’ - x’| < \eta\),
\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split} [f(x’, y’) - \epsilon](a_1 - x’) & < \phi^{(n)}(a_1) -
\phi^{(n)}(x’) < [f(x’, y’) + \epsilon](a_1 - x’), \\
[f(x’, y’) - \epsilon](a_{i+1} - a_i) & < \phi^{(n)}(a_{i+1}) -
\phi^{(n)}(a_i) \\
& < [f(x’, y’) + \epsilon](a_{i+1} - a_i) \quad (i=1, 2, \ldots,
k-1), \\
[f(x’, y’) - \epsilon](x’’ - a_k) & < \phi^{(n)}(x’’) -
\phi^{(n)}(a_k) < [f(x’, y’) + \epsilon](x’’ - a_k).
\end{split}\end{equation}\]
Adding these inequalities, we get
\[[f(x’, y’) - \epsilon](x’’ - x’) < \phi^{(n)}(x’’) - \phi^{(n)}(x’) <
[f(x’, y’) + \epsilon](x’’ - x’)\]
if \(|x’’ - x’| < \eta\), which is equivalent to
\[|\frac{\phi^{(n)}(x’’) - \phi^{(n)}(x’)}{x’’-x’} - f(x’, \phi^{(n)}(x’))|
< \epsilon.\]
