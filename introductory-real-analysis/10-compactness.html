<p>
<b>Heine-Borel Theorem</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org29dc207">
<p>
Any cover of a closed interval \([a, b]\) by a sytem of open intervals (or, more
generally, open sets) has a finite subcover.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
A topological space \(T\) is said to be <i>compact</i> if every open cover of \(T\) has
a finite subcover. A compact Hausdorff space is called a <i>compactum</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
A system of subsets \(\{A_\alpha\}\) of a set \(T\) is said to be <i>centered</i> if
every finite intersection \(\cap_{k=1}^n A_k\) is nonempty (also called the
finite intersection property).
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org0e810d2">
<p>
A topological space \(T\) is compact if and only if every centered system of
closed subsets of \(T\) has a nonempty intersection.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
[Credit to <a href="https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-finite-intersection-property-in-compact-spaces-and-countably-compact-spaces/">Dan Ma</a> for this proof; I was unable to fully understand the proof
given in the book.]
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgc2a5e00">
<p>
Let \(T\) be compact and \(\{F_\alpha\}\) any centered system of closed subsets of
\(T\). For contradiction, assume \(\cap_\alpha F_\alpha = \emptyset\), then
\(\{G_\alpha\} = \{T - F_\alpha\}\) is an open cover of \(T\). By the compactness
of \(T\), \(G_\alpha\) has a finite subcover
\(\{T - F_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, T - F_{\alpha_n}\}\)
implying that \(\cap_{k = 1}^n F_{\alpha_k} = \emptyset\). Contradiction.
Therefore \(\cap_\alpha F_\alpha \not= \emptyset\).
</p>

<p>
Conversely, let \(\{G_\alpha\}\) be an open cover of \(T\) with no finite subcover,
then \(\{F_\alpha\} = \{T - G_\alpha\}\) is a centered system of
closed subsets of \(T\) with \(\cap_\alpha F_\alpha = \emptyset\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org6a4f1e9">
<p>
Every closed subset \(F\) of a compact topological space \(T\) is itself compact.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org43f380b">
<p>
Let \(\{F_\alpha\}\) be any centered system of closed subset of the subspace
\(F \subseteq T\). Then every \(F_\alpha\) is closed in \(T\) as well, therefore
\(\cap_\alpha F_\alpha \not= \emptyset\). Then by Theorem 1, \(F\) is compact.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Corollary</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org6b28540">
<p>
Every closed subset of a compactum is itself a compactum.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orged23240">
<p>
By Theorem 2 and the fact that every subset of a Hausdorff space is itself a
Hausdorff space.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 3</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org3b48eda">
<p>
Let \(K\) be a compactum and \(T\) any Hausdorff space containing \(K\). Then \(K\) is
closed in \(T\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orga1e5e51">
<p>
Suppose \(y \notin K\), so that \(y \in T- K\). Then, for anytenoint \(x \in K\),
there is a neighbourhood \(U_x\) of \(x\) and \(V_x\) of \(y\) such that
\(U_x \cap V_x = \emptyset\). The neighbourhood \(U_x\) for \(x \in K\) form an open
cover of \(K\). Hence, by the compactness of \(K\), \(\{U_x\}\) has a finite subcover
consisting of sets \(U_{x_1}, \ldots U_{x_n}\). Let
\(V = V_{x_1} \cap \ldots \cap V_{x_n}\). Then \(V\) is a neighbourhood of the
point \(y\) which does not intersect the set
\(U_{x_1} \cup \ldots \cup U_{x_n} \supseteq K\), and hence \(y \notin [K]\). It
follows that \(K\) is closed (in \(T\)).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Remark</b>
It is a consequence of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 that compactness is an
‘intrinsic property’, in the sense that a compactum remains a compactum after
being ‘embedded’ in any larger Hausdorff space.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 4</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org8b580d8">
<p>
Every compactum \(K\) is a normal space.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org31e1c09">
<p>
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be any two disjoint closed subsets of \(K\). Reporting the
argument given in the proof of Theorem 3, we easily see that, given any point
\(y \in Y\), there exists a neighbourhood \(U_y\) containing \(y\) and an open set
\(O_y \supseteq X\) such that \(U_y \cap O_y = \emptyset\). Since \(Y\) is compact,
by Theorem 2, the cover \(\{U_y\} (y \in Y)\) of the set \(Y\) has a finite
subcover \(U_{y_1}, \ldots, U_{y_n}\). The open sets
\(O^{(1)} = O_{y_1} \cap \ldots \cap O_{y_n}\),
\(O^{(2)} = U_{y_1} \cap \ldots \cap U_{y_n}\)
then satisfy the normality conditions
\(O^{(1)} \supseteq X\),
\(O^{(2)} \supseteq Y\),
\(O^{(1)} \cap O^{(2)} = \emptyset\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgc70528c">
<p>
Let \(X\) be a compact space and \(f\) a continuous mapping of \(X\) onto a
topological space \(Y\). Then \(Y = f(X)\) is itself compact.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org854f682">
<p>
Let \(\{V_\alpha\}\) be any open cover of \(Y\), and let
\(U_\alpha = f^{-1}(V_\alpha)\). Then the sets \(U_\alpha\) are open (being
preimages of open sets under a continuous mapping) and cover the space \(X\).
Since \(X\) is compact, \(\{U_\alpha\}\) has a finite subcover
\(U_{x_1}, \ldots, U_{x_n}\). Then the sets \(V_{x_1}, \ldots V_{x_n}\), where
\(V_k = f(U_k)\), cover \(Y\). It follows that \(Y\) is compact.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 6</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org1296ea5">
<p>
A one-to-one continuous mapping  of a compactum \(X\) onto a compactum \(Y\) is
necessarily a homeomorphism.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org50c7e28">
<p>
We must show that \(f^{-1}\) is continuous too. Let \(F\) be a closed set in \(X\)
and \(P = f(F)\) be its image in \(Y\). Then \(P\) is a compactum, by Theorem 5.
Hence, by Theorem 3, \(P\) is closed in \(Y\). Therefore the preimage under
\(f^{-1}\) of any closed set \(F \subseteq X\) is closed. It follows from Theorem
10’ (from <a href="./09-topological-spaces-basic-concepts.html">Topological Spaces: Basic Concepts</a>) that \(f^{-1}\) is continuous.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 7</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgec195a6">
<p>
If \(T\) is a compact space, then any infinite subset of \(T\) has at least one
limit point.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orga891eec">
<p>
Suppose \(T\) contains an infinite set \(X\) with no limit point. Then \(T\) contains
a countable set \(X = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}\) with no limit point. But then the
sets \(F_n = \{x_n, x_{n+1}, \ldots\} (n = 1, 2, \ldots)\) form a centered system
of closed sets in \(T\) with an empty intersection ,i.e., \(T\) is not compact.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
A topological space \(T\) is said to be <i>countably compact</i> if every infinite
subset of \(T\) has at least one limit point (in \(T\)).
</p>

<p>
<b>Remark</b>
Theorem 7 says that every compact set is countably compact. The converse,
however, is not true (see Problem 1).
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 8</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org8bf4c2c">
<p>
Each of the following two conditions is necessary and sufficient for a
topological space \(T\) to be countably compact:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>every countable open cover of \(T\) has a finite subcover;</p></li>
<li><p>every countable centered system of closed subsets of \(T\) has a non-empty
intersection.</p></li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgefb3afe">
<p>
The equivalence of conditions 1 and 2 is an immediate consequence of the
duality principle. Moreover, if \(T\) is not countably compact, then, repeating
the argument given in proving Theorem 7, we find that there is a countable
centered system of closed subsets of \(T\) with an empty intersection. This
proves the sufficiency of condition 2. Thus we need only prove the necessity of
condition 2.
</p>

<p>
Let \(T\) be countably compact, and let \(\{F_n\}\) be a countable centered system
of closed sets in \(T\). Then, as we now show, \(\cap_n F_n \not= \emptyset\). Let
\(\Phi_n = \cap_{k=1}^n F_k\). Then none of the \(\Phi_n\) is empty, since
\(\{F_k\}\) is centered. Moreover,
\(\Phi_1 \supseteq \ldots \supseteq \Phi_n \supseteq \ldots\) and
\(\cap_n \Phi_n = \cap_n F_n\). There are now two possibilities:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>\(\Phi_{n_0} = \Phi_{n_0 + 1} = \ldots\) starting from some index \(n_0\), in
which case it is obvious that \(\cap_n \Phi_n = \Phi_{n_0} \not= \emptyset\) .</p></li>
<li><p>There are infinitely many distinct sets \(\Phi_n\). In this case, there is
clearly no loss in generality in assuming that all the \(\Phi_n\) are
distinct. Let \(x_n \in \Phi_n - \Phi_{n+1}\). Thn the sequence \(\{x_n\}\)
consists of infinitely many distinct points of \(T\), and hence, by the
countable compactness of \(T\), must have at least one limit point, say \(x_0\).
But then \(x_0\) must be a limit point of \(\Phi_n\), since \(\Phi_n\) contains
all the points \(x_n, x_{n+1}, \ldots\). Moreover \(x_0 \in \Phi_n\), since
\(\Phi_n\) is closed. It follows that \(x_0 \in \cap_n \Phi_n\) i.e.
\(\cap_n \Phi_n \not= \emptyset\).</p></li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
<b>Remark</b>
Thus compact topological spaces are those in which an <i>arbitrary</i> open cover
has a finite subcover, while countably compoact spaces are those in which every
<i>countable</i> open cover has a finite subcover.

<b>Theorem 9</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org0e5bcaa">
<p>
The concepts of compactness and countable compactness coincide for a
topological space \(T\) with a countable base.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org4405e9d">
<p>
By Theorem 6 (from <a href="./09-topological-spaces-basic-concepts.html">Topological Spaces: Basic Concepts</a>), every open cover
\(\mathscr{O}\) of \(T\) has a countable subcover. Hence, if \(T\) is countably
compact, \(\mathscr{O}\) has a finite subcover, by Theorem 8.
