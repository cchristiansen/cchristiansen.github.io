Definitions of <i>system of sets</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition 1</b>
A nonempty system of sets \(\mathscr{R}\) is called a <i>ring (of sets)</i> if
\(A \triangle B \in \mathscr{R}\) and \(A \cap B \in \mathscr{R}\) for all \(A \in
\mathscr{R}\), \(B \in \mathscr{R}\).
</p>

<p>
Since \(A \cup B = (A \triangle B) \triangle (A \cap B)\) and \(A - B = A
\triangle (A \cap B)\), a ring is closed under union and difference too. Since
\(A - A = \emptyset\), a ring must contain the empty set. \(E \in \mathscr{R}\) is
a <i>unit</i> if \(A \cap E \in A\) for all \(A \in \mathscr{R}\). A ring of sets with
a unit, is an <i>algebra (of sets)</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgd2a4d40">
<p>
The intersection \(\mathscr{R} = \cap_\alpha \mathscr{R}_\alpha\) of any set of
rings is itself a ring.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orged88803">
<p>
An immediate consequence of Definition 1.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org4232928">
<p>
Given any nonempty system of sets \(\mathscr{S}\), there is a unique ring
\(\mathscr{P}\) containing \(\mathscr{S}\) and contained in every ring containing
\(\mathscr{S}\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgbf64035">
<p>
If \(\mathscr{P}\) exists, then clearly \(\mathscr{P}\) is unique. To prove
\(\mathscr{P}\) exists, consider the union \[X = \cup_{A \in \mathscr{S}} A\] of
all sets \(A\) belonging to \(\mathscr{S}\) and the ring \(\mathscr{M}(X)\)
of all subsets of \(X\). Let \(\Sigma\) be the set of all rings contained in
\(\mathscr{M}(X)\) and containing \(\mathscr{S}\). Then the intersection
\[\mathscr{P} = \cap_{\mathscr{R} \in \Sigma} \mathscr{R}\] of all these rings
clearly has the desired properties. \(\mathscr{P}\) clearly contains
\(\mathscr{S}\). Moreover, if \(\mathscr{R}^*\) is any ring containing
\(\mathscr{S}\), then the intersection \(\mathscr{R} = \mathscr{R}^* \cup
\mathscr{M}(X)\) is a ring in \(\Sigma\) and hence \(\mathscr{P} \subseteq
\mathscr{R} \subseteq \mathscr{R}^*\), as required.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The ring \(\mathscr{P}\) is the <i>minimal ring</i> generated by the system
\(\mathscr{S}\), and will henceforth be denoted by \(\mathscr{R}(\mathscr{P})\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Defintion 2</b>
A system of sets \(\mathscr{S}\) is a <i>semiring</i> if
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>\(\mathscr{S}\) contains the empty set \(\emptyset\);</p></li>
<li><p>\(A \cap B \in \mathscr{S}\) for all \(A, B \in \mathscr{S}\);</p></li>
<li><p>If \(\mathscr{S}\) contains the sets \(A\) and \(A_1 \subseteq A\), then \(A\) can</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
be represented as a finite union
\[A = \cup_{k=1}^{n} A_k\]
of pairwise disjoint sets of \(\mathscr{S}\), with the given set \(A_1\) as its
first term. (This is called a <i>finite expansion</i> of \(A\).)
</p>

<p>
<b>Lemma 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org1ca6ee8">
<p>
Suppose the sets \(A\), \(A_1\), …, \(A_n\), where \(A_1\), …, \(A_n\) are pairwise
disjoint subsets of \(A\), all belong to semiring \(\mathscr{S}\). Then there is
finite expansion
\[A = \cup_{k=1}^s A_k (s \geq n)\]
with \(A_1\), …, \(A_n\) as its first \(n\) terms, where \(A_k \in \mathscr{S}\), \(A_k
\cap A_l = \emptyset\) for all \(k, l = 1, …, n\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org4815826">
<p>
The lemma holds for \(n=1\), by the definition of a semiring. Suppose the lemma
holds for \(n=m\), and consider \(m+1\) sets \(A_1\), …, \(A_m\), \(A_{m+1}\) satisfying
the conditions of the lemma. By hypothesis,
\[A = A_1 \cup … \cup A_m \cup B_1 \cup … \cup B_p\]
where the sets \(A_1\), …, \(A_m\), \(B_1\), …, \(B_p\) are pairwise disjoint subsets
of \(A\), all belonging to \(\mathscr{S}\). Let
\[B_{q1} = A_{m+1} \cap B_{q}\]
By the defintion of a semiring
\[B_{q} = B_{q1} \cup … \cup B_{qr_q}\]
where the sets \(B_{qj}\) (\(j=1\), …, \(r_q\)) are pairwise disjoint subset of
\(B_q\), all belong to \(\mathscr{S}\). But then,
\[A = A_1 \cup … \cup A_m \cup _{m+1} \cup_{q=1}^p (\cup_{j=2}^{r_q} B_{qj})\]
i.e., the lemma is true for \(n = m + 1\). Mathematical induction completes the
proof.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Lemma 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org0bdf9e3">
<p>
Given any finite system of sets \(A_1, …, A_n\) belonging to a semiring
\(\mathscr{S}\), there is a finite system of pairwise disjoint sets \(B_1\), …,
\(B_t\) belonging to \(\mathscr{S}\) such that every \(A_k\) has a finite expansion
\[A_k = \cup_{s \in M_k} B_s (k=1, …, n)\]
with respect to certain of the sets \(B_s\). (Here \(M_k\) denotes some subset of
\(\{1, 2, …, t\}\), depending on the choice of \(k\).)
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org3b9f988">
<p>
The lemma is trivial for \(n = 1\). Suppose the lemma is true for \(n = m\) and
consider a system of sets \(A_1\), …, \(A_m\), \(A_{m+1}\). Let \(B_1\), …, \(B_t\) be
sets of \(\mathscr{S}\) satisfying the conditions of the lemma with repsect to
\(a_1\), …, \(A_m\), and let
\[B_{s1} = SA_{m+1} \cap B_s\]
Then, by Lemma 1, there is an expansion
\[A_{m+1} = (\cup_{s=1}^t B_{s1}) \cup (\cup_{p = 1}^q B’_p) (B’_p \in
\mathscr{S})\]
while, by the very definition of a semiring, there is an expansion
\[B_s = B_{s1} \cup … \cup B_{sr_s} (B_{sj} \in \mathscr{S})\]
It is easy to see that \(A_k = \cup_{s \in M_k} (\cup_{j=1}^{r_s} B_{sj} (k = 1,
…, m)\) for some suitable \(M_k\). Moreover, the sets \(B_{sj}\), \(B’_p\) are
pairwise disjoint. Hence the sets \(B_sj\), \(B’_p\) satisfy the conditions of the
lemma with repect to \(A_1, …, A_m, A_{m+1}\). Mathematical induction completes
the proof.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 3</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgb4ca359">
<p>
If \(\mathscr{S)\) is a semiring, then \(\mathscr{R}(\mathscr{S})\) coincides with
the system \(\mathscr{Z}\) of all sets \(A\) which have finite expansions
\[A = \cup_{k=1}^n A_k\]
with respect to the sets \(A_k \in \mathscr{S}\) .
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgf5538fa">
<p>
FIrst prove \(\mathscr{Z}\) is a ring. Let \(A, B \in \mathscr{Z}\). Then there are
expansions
\[A = \cup_{i=1}^m A_i (A_i \in \mathscr{S}, B = \cup_{j=1}^n B_j (B_j \in
\mathscr{S}\]
Since \(\mathscr{S}\) is a semiring, the sets \(C_{ij} = A_i \cap B_j\) also belong
to \(\mathscr{S}\).
</p>

<p>
By Lemma 1, there are expansions
\[A_i = (\cup_{j=1}^n C_{ij}) \cup (\cup_{k=1}^{r_i} D_{ik}) (D_{ik} \in
\mathscr{S})\]
\[B_j = (\cup_{i=1}^m C_{ij}) \cup (\cup_{l=1}^{s_j} E_{jl}) (E_{jl} \in
\mathscr{S})\]
It follows that \(A \cap B\) and \(A \triangle B\) have the expansions
\[A \cap B = \cup_{i, j} C_{ij}\]
\[A \triangle B = (\cup_{i, k} D_{ik}) \cup (\cup_{j, l} E_{jl})\]
and hence belong to \(\mathscr{Z}\). Therefore \(\mathscr{Z}\) is a ring. That
\(\mathscr{Z}\) is the minimal ring generated by \(\mathscr{S}\), is obvious.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Definition 3</b>
A ring of sets is a <i>\(\sigma\)​-ring</i> if it contains the union
\[S = \cup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\]
whenever it contains the sets \(A_1, …, A_n, …\). A \(\sigma\)​-ring with a unit \(E\)
is called a <i>\(\sigma\)​-algebra</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition 4</b>
A ring of sets is called a <i>\(\delta\)​-ring</i> if it contains the intersection
\[D = \cap_{n=1}^\infty A_n\]
whenever it contains the sets \(A_1, …, A_n, …\). A \(\delta\)​-ring with a unit is
called a <i>\(\delta\)​-algebra</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 4</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org745744f">
<p>
Every \(\sigma\)​-algebra is a \(\delta\)​-algebra and conversely.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgafb919d">
<p>
From the ‘dual’ formulas:
\[\cup_n A_n = E - \cap_n (E - A_n)\]
\[\cap_n A_n = E - \cup_n (E - A_n)\]
</p>

</div>

<p>
\(\sigma\)​-algebras (and equivalently \(\delta\)​​-algebras) are also called <i>Borel
algebras (B-algebras)</i>.
</p>

<p>
A Borel algebra \(\mathscr{B}\) is <i>irreducible (with respect to the system
\(\mathscr{S}\)</i> if it contains no points that do not belong to one of the sets
\(A \in \mathscr{S}\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org66b12ea">
<p>
Given any nonempty system of sets \(\mathscr{S}\), there is a unique irreducible
(with respect to \(\mathscr{S}\)) B-algebra \(\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{S})\) containing
\(\mathscr{S}\) and contained in every B-algebra containing \(\mathscr{S}\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org0129c4e">
<p>
Virtually identical to that of Theorem 2. The B-algebra
\(\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{S})\) is called the <i>minimal B-algebra</i> generated by the
system \(\mathscr{S}\) or the <i>Borel closure</i> of \(\mathscr{S}\).
