<p>
<b>Definition</b>
Given a set \(X\), a <i>topology</i> in \(X\) is a system \(\tau\) of subsets
\(G \subseteq X\), called <i>open sets</i> (relative to \(\tau\)), with the following
two properties:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>\(X\) and \(\emptyset\) belong to \(\tau\);</p></li>
<li><p>arbitrary unions \(\cup_\alpha G_\alpha\) and finite intersections
\(\cap_{k=1}^n G_k\) of open sets belong to \(\tau\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
A <i>topological space</i> is a pair \((X, \tau)\) consisting of a set \(X\) and a
topology \(\tau\) defined in \(X\).
</p>

<p>
<b>More definitions</b>
Elements of a topological space are called <i>points</i>. <i>Closed sets</i> are the
complements of open sets. A <i>neighbourhood</i> of a point \(x\) is any open set
containing the point. A point \(x \in T\) is a <i>contact point</i> of a set
\(M \subseteq T\) if every neighbourhood of \(x\) contains at least one point of
\(M\). A point \(x \in T\) is a <i>limit point</i> of a set \(M \subseteq T\) if every
neighbourhood of \(x\) contains infinitely many points of \(M\). The set of all
contact points of a set \(M \subseteq T\) is called a <i>closure</i> of \(M\), denoted
by \([M]\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>
Example 4, in which \(T = \{a, b\}\) and the open sets are \(\emptyset\), \(\{b\}\)
and \(T\), with \([T] = \{b\}\), demonstrates that the closure is the set of all
contact points and not limit points.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
Let \(\tau_1\) and \(\tau_2\) be two topologies defined in the same set \(X\). Then
\(\tau_1\) is <i>stronger</i> than \(\tau_2\) (or equivalently \(\tau_2\) is <i>weaker</i> than
\(\tau_1\)) if \(\tau_2 \subseteq \tau_1\), i.e. every set of the system \(\tau_2\)
is a set of the system \(\tau_1\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org1cf69c2">
<p>
The intersection \(\tau = \cap_\alpha \tau_\alpha\) of any sets of topologies in
\(X\) is itself a topology in \(X\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgd4b5ecc">
<p>
Clearly \(\cap_\alpha \tau_\alpha\) contains \(X\) and \(\emptyset\). Also, every
\(\tau_\alpha\) is closed (algebraically) under the operations of taking
arbitrary unions and finite intersections, the same is true of
\(\cap_\alpha \tau_\alpha\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Corollary</b>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org6a0b8ca">
<p>
Let \(\mathscr{B}\) be any system of subsets of a set \(X\). Then there exists a
minimal topology in \(X\) containing \(\mathscr{B}\), i.e. a topology
\(\tau(\mathscr{B})\) containing \(\mathscr{B}\) and contained in every topology
containing \(\mathscr{B}\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org45a97f4">
<p>
A topology containing \(\mathscr{B}\) always exists, e.g. the topology in which
every subset of \(X\) is open. The intersection fo all topologies containing
\(\mathscr{B}\) is the desired minimal topology \(\tau(\mathscr{B})\), often called
the topology <i>generated</i> by the system \(\mathscr{B}\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>More definitions</b>
Let \(\mathscr{B}\) be a system of subsets of \(X\), and \(A\) a fixed subset of \(X\).
Then the <i>trace</i> of the system \(\mathscr{B}\) on the set \(A\) is the system
\(\mathscr{B}_A\) consisting of all subsets of \(X\) of the form \(A \cap B\),
\(B \in \mathscr{B}\). The trace (on A) of a topology \(\tau\) (defined in \(X\)) is
a topology \(\tau_A\) in \(A\), often called a <i>relative</i> topology. In this sense,
every subset \(A\) of a given topological space \((X, \tau)\) generates a new
topological space \((A, \tau_A)\) called a <i>subspace</i> of the original topological
space \((X, \tau)\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
A family \(\mathscr{G}\) of open subsets of a topological space \(T\) is called a
<i>base</i> for \(T\) if every open set in \(T\) can be represented as a union of sets
in \(\mathscr{G}\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org40cd99b">
<p>
Given a set \(T\), let \(\mathscr{G}\) be a system of subsets
\(G_\alpha \subseteq T\) with the following two properties:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>every point \(x \in T\) belongs to at least one \(G_\alpha \in \mathscr{G}\);</p></li>
<li><p>if \(x \in G_\alpha \cap G_\beta\), then there is a \(G_\gamma \in \mathscr{G}\)
such that \(x \in G_\gamma \in G_\alpha \cap G_\beta\).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Suppose the empty set \(\emptyset\) and all sets representable as unions of sets
\(G_\alpha\) are designated as open. Then \(T\) is a topological space, and
\(\mathscr{G}\) is a base for \(T\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org4205c66">
<p>
Evident from the conditions of the theorem that the whole set \(T\) and the empty
set \(\emptyset\) are open sets; and the union of any number of open sets is
open. Just have to show that the intersection of a finite number of open sets
is open. It is enough to prove this for just two (arbitary) sets. Let
\(A = \cup_\alpha G_\alpha\),
\(B = \cup_\beta G_\beta\).
Then \(A \cap B = \cup_{\alpha, \beta} (G_\alpha \cap G_\beta)\) (1).
By hypothesis, for any point \(x \in G_\alpha \cap G_\beta\) there exists a
\(G_\gamma \in \mathscr{G}\) such that
\(x \in G_\gamma \subseteq G_\alpha \cap G_\beta\). Hence the set
\(G_\alpha \cap G_\beta\) is open, being the union of all \(G_\gamma\) contained in
\(G_\alpha \cap G_\beta\). But then (1) is also open. Thus \(T\) is a topological
space. The fact that \(\mathscr{G}\) is a base for \(T\) is clear from the way open
sets in \(T\) are defined.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 3</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org4b61bc3">
<p>
A system \(\mathscr{G}\) of open sets \(G_\alpha\) in a topological space \(T\) is a
base for \(T\) if and only if, given any open set \(G \subseteq T\) and any point
\(x \in G\), there is a set \(G_\alpha \in \mathscr{G}\) such that
\(x \in G_\alpha \subseteq G\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org05ed84c">
<p>
If \(\mathscr{G}\) is a base for \(T\), then every open set \(G \subseteq T\) is set
\(G \subseteq T\) and any point
\(x \in G\), there is a set \(G_\alpha \in \mathscr{G}\) such that
\(x \in G_\alpha \subseteq G\). union \(G = \cup_\alpha G_\alpha\) of sets
\(G_\alpha \in \mathscr{G}\). Therefore every point \(x \in G\) is contained in
some set \(G_\alpha \subseteq G\). Conversely given anyten set \(G \subseteq T\),
suppose that for every point \(x \in G\) there is a set \(G_\alpha(x) \in
\mathscr{G}\) such that \(x \in G_\alpha(x) \subseteq G\). Then
\(G = \cup_{x \in G} G_\alpha (x)\), i.e. \(G\) is a union of sets in
\(\mathscr{G}\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>More definitions</b>
Topological spaces <i>with a countable base</i> have at least one base containing no
more than countably many sets. Such a space is said to satisfy the
<i>second axiom of countability</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 4</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgc4e963c">
<p>
If a topological space \(T\) has a countable base, then \(T\) contains a countable
everywhere dense subset, i.e. a countable set \(M \subseteq T\) such that
\([M] \subseteq T\).
</p>

</div>
<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orga201d1f">
<p>
Let \(\mathscr{G} = \{G_1, \ldots, G_n, \ldots\}\) be a countable base for \(T\),
and choose a point \(x_n\) in each \(G_n\). Then the set
\(M = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \ldots\}\) is countable. Moreover, \(M\) is
everywhere dense in \(T\), since otherwise the nonempty open set \(G = T - [M]\)
would contain no points of \(M\). But this is impossible, since \(G\) is a union of
some of the sets \(G_n\) in \(\mathscr{G}\) and \(G_n\) contains the point
\(x_n \in M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org06e2800">
<p>
If a metric space \(R\) has a countable everywhere dense subset, then \(R\) has a
countable base.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org7fee71a">
<p>
Suppose \(R\) has a countable everywhere dense subset \(\{x_1, \ldots, x_n,
\ldots\}\). Then, given any open set \(G \subseteq R\) and any \(x \in G\), there is
an open sphere \(S(x_m, \frac{1}{n})\) such that
\(x \in S(x_m, \frac{1}{n}) \subseteq G\) for suitable positive integers \(m\) and
\(n\) (why?). Hence the open sphere \(S(x_m, \frac{1}{n})\), where \(m\) and \(n\)
range over all positive integers, form a countable base for \(R\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Note</b>
Combining Theorems 4 and 5, we see that a metric space \(R\) has a countable base
if and only if it has a countable everywhere dense set.
</p>

<p>
<b>More definitions</b>
A system \(\mathscr{M}\) of sets \(M_\alpha\) is a <i>cover</i> (or <i>covering</i>) of a
topological space \(T\), and \(\mathscr{M}\) is said to <i>cover</i> \(T\), if
\(T = \cup_\alpha M_\alpha\). A cover consisting of open (or closed) sets only is
called an <i>open</i> (or <i>closed</i>) cover. If \(\mathscr{M}\) is a cover of a
topological space \(T\), then by a <i>subcover</i> of \(\mathscr{M}\) we mean any subset
of \(\mathscr{M}\) which also covers \(T\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 6</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org0643ef1">
<p>
If \(T\) is a topological space with a countable base \(\mathscr{G}\), then every
open cover \(\mathscr{O}\) has a finite or countable subcover.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgbb8d46d">
<p>
Since \(\mathscr{O}\) covers \(T\), each point \(x \in T\) belongs to some open set
\(O_\alpha \in \mathscr{O}\). Moreover, since \(\mathscr{G}\) is a countable base
for \(T\), for each \(x \in T\) there is a set \(G_n(x)\) such that
\(x \in G_n (x) \subseteq O_\alpha\). The collection of all sets \(G_n (x)\)
selected in this way is finite or countable and covers \(T\). For each \(G_n (x)\)
we now choose one of the sets \(O_\alpha\) containing \(G_n(x)\), thereby obtaining
a finite or countable subcover of \(\mathscr{O}\).
</p>

</div>

<b>More definitions</b>
A topological space \(T\) is <i>connected</i> if it has no subsets other than
\(\emptyset\) and \(T\) which are both open and closed.

<b>Theorem 7</b>
</p>

<p>
If a topological space \(T\) satisfies the <i>first axiom of countability</i>, i.e. if
there is a countable neighbourhood base at every point \(x \in T\), then every
contact point \(x\) of a set \(M \subseteq T\) is the limit of a convergent
sequence of points in \(M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org9c79138">
<p>
Let \(\mathscr{O}\) be a countable neighbourhood base at \(x\), consisting of sets
\(O_n\). it can be assumed that \(O_{n+1} \subseteq O_n (n = 1, 2, \ldots)\),
since otherwise we need only replace \(O_n\) by \(\cap_{k=1}^n O_k\). Let \(x_n\) be
any point of \(M\) contained in \(O_n\). Such a point \(x_n\) can always be found,
since \(x\) is a contact point of \(M\). Then the sequence \(\{x_n\}\) obviously
converges to \(x\).

<b>Defintion</b>
Suppose that for each pair of distinct points \(x\) and \(y\) in a topological
space \(T\), there is a neighbourhood \(O_x\) of \(x\) and a neighbourhood \(O_y\) of
\(y\) such that \(x \notin O_y\), \(y \notin O_x\). Then \(T\) is said to satisfy the
<i>first axiom of separation</i> and is called a <i>\(T_1\)​-space</i>.

<p>
Given any single-element set \(\{x\}\), suppose \(y \neq x\). Then \(y\) has a

Therefore \([\{x\}] = \{x\}\), i.e. every ‘singleton’ \(\{x\}\) is closed. But
every finite union of closed sets is itself closed. Hence every finite subset
of the given space is closed.

<b>Definition</b>
Suppose that for each pair of distinct points \(x\) and \(y\) in a topological
space \(T\), there is a neighbourhood \(O_x\) of \(x\) and a neighbourhood \(O_y\) of
\(y\) such that \(O_x \cap O_y = \emptyset\). Then \(T\) is said to satisfy the
<i>second</i> (or <i>Hausdorff</i>) <i>axiom of separation</i> and is called a <i>\(T_2\)​-space</i>
or <i>Hausdorff space</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition</b>
A \(T_1\)​-space \(T\) is said to be <i>normal</i> if for each pair of disjoint closed
sets \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) in \(T\), there is an open set \(O_1\) containing \(F_1\)

<b>Theorem 9</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org87e89c9">
<p>
Every metric space is normal.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org4af9a1e">
<p>
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be any two disjoint closed subsets of \(R\). Every point \(x
\in X\) has a neighbourhood \(O_x\) disjoint from \(Y\), and hence is at a positive
distance \(\rho_x\) from \(Y\) (recall Problem 9 from page 54). Similarly, every
point \(y \in Y\) is at a positive distance \(\rho_y\) form \(X\). Consider the open
sets
\(U = \cup_{x \in X} S(x, \frac{1}{2} \rho_x)\),
\(V = \cup_{y \in Y} S(y, \frac{1}{2} \rho_y)\),
where, as usual, \(S(x, r)\) is the open sphere with center \(x\) and radius \(r\).
It is clear that \(X \subseteq U\), \(Y \subseteq V\). Moreover, \(U\) and \(V\) are
disjoint. In fact, suppose to the contrary that there is a point
\(z \in U \cap V\). Then there are points \(x_0 \in X\), \(y_0 \in Y\) such that
\(\rho(x_0, z) < \frac{1}{2} \rho_{x_0}\),
\(\rho(z, y_0) < \frac{1}{2} \rho_{y_0}\).
Assume, to be explicit, that \(\rho_{x_0} \leq \rho_{y_0}\). Then
\(\rho(x_0, y_0) \leq \rho(x_0, z) + \rho(z, y_0) < \frac{1}{2} \rho_{x_0} +
\frac{1}{2} \rho_{y_0} \leq \rho_{y_0}\)
i.e. \(x_0 \in S(y_0, \rho_y)\). This contradicts the definition of \(\rho_{y_0}\),
and shows that there is no point \(z \in U \cap V\).

<b>More definitions</b>
Let \(f\) be a mapping of one topological space \(X\) into another topological
space \(Y\), so that \(f\) associates an element \(y = f(x) \in Y\) with each element
\(x \in X\). Then \(f\) is said to be <i>continuous at a point</i> \(x_0 \in X\) if, given
any neighbourhood \(V_{y_0}\) of the point \(y_0 = f(x_0)\), there is a
neighbourhood \(U_{x_0}\) of the point \(x_0\) such that
\(f(U_{x_0}) \subseteq V_{y_0}\). \(f\) is <i>continuous on</i> \(X\) if it is continuous
at every point of \(X\). A continuous mapping of a topological space \(X\) into the
real line is called a continuous real function on \(X\).

<p>
<b>Theorem 10</b>

<p>
A mapping \(f\) of a topological space \(X\) into a topological space \(Y\) is

<p>
<i>Proof</i>

<div class="proof" id="org32617bc">
<p>
Suppose \(f\) is continuous and \(G\) is an open subset of \(Y\). Choose
\(x \in \Gamma = f^{-1}(G)\) and let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(G\) is a neighbourhood of
\(y\). By continuity of \(f\), tyhere is a neighbourhood \(U_x\) of \(x\) such that
\(f(U_x) \subseteq G\), i.e. \(U_x \subseteq \Gamma\). In other words, every point
\(x \in \Gamma\) has a neighbourhood contained in \(\Gamma\), so \(\Gamma\) is open.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, suppose \(\Gamma = f^{-1}(G)\) is open whenever \(G \subseteq Y\) is
open. Let \(x \in X\) and \(V_y\) be a neighbourhood of \(y = f(x)\). Then clearly
\(x \in f^{-1}(V_y)\), and \(f^{-1}(V_y)\) is open, by hypothesis. Therefore
\(U_x = f^{-1}(V_y)\) is a neighbourhood of \(x\) such that \(f(U_x) \subseteq V_y\).
In other words, \(f\) is continuous at \(x\) and hence on \(X\), since \(x\) is an

\(\cup_{x \in G} O_x \subseteq G\) is open, as topologies are closed under
arbitrary unions. However \(\cup_{x \in G} O_x \supseteq G\) since

Conversely, if \(M\) is closed, then \(T-M\) is open. Let \(x \in T-M\) and
assume for contradiction that \(x\) is a contact point of \(M\). Then every
neighbourhood of \(x\) contains at least one point of \(M\). However, \(T-M\)
is open, and hence a neighbourhood of \(x\), and it doesn’t include

If \(M \subseteq N\), then \([M] \subseteq [N]\);

<p>
Let \(M \subseteq N\). Assume for contradiction that there exists
\(x \in [M]\) such that \(x \notin [N]\). But then \(x\) is a contact point
of \(M\), and not of \(M\), which is impossible as \(M\) is contained in
\(N\). Contradiction.

\([[M]]\) = [M];

\([M]\) is closed, so by the result of 2.1, \([[M]] = [M]\).

\([M \cup N] = [M] \cup [N]\);
</p>

<p>
\(M \cup N \subseteq [M] \cup [N]\). Taking closure of both sides, we
have \([M \cup N] \subseteq [[M] \cup [N]] = [M] \cup [N]\), as the
union of two closed sets is itself closed.
</p>

<p>
Both \([M] \subseteq [M \cup N]\) and \([N] \subseteq [M \cup N]\). Hence
\([M] \cup [N] \subseteq [M \cup N]\), since both \([M]\) and \([N]\) are
subsets.

<p>
Combining the two inequalities, we get the desired result.

Consider the set \(\mathscr{T}\) of all possible topologies defined in a set
\(X\), where \(\tau_2 \leq \tau_1\) means \(\tau_2\) is weaker than \(\tau_1\).
Verify \(\leq\) is a partial ordering of \(\mathscr{T}\). Does \(\mathscr{T}\)
have maximal and minimal elements? If so, what are they?
</p>

<p>
We need to show that the relation is reflexive, transitive and
antisymmetric.
</p>

<p>
Reflexive as any topology \(\tau\) contains all of its own sets, i.e.
\(\tau \leq \tau\).
</p>

<p>
Transitive since if \(\tau_1 \leq \tau_2\), i.e. all of the sets in \(\tau_1\)
are in \(\tau_2\), and \(\tau_2 \leq \tau_3\), i.e. all of the sets in \(\tau_2\)
are in \(\tau_3\), then \(\tau_1 \leq \tau_3\).
</p>

<p>
Antisymmetry follows too, since if \(\tau_2\) contains all of the sets of
\(\tau_1\), then \(\tau_2 \leq \tau_1\) only if \(\tau_1\) contains all of the
sets of \(\tau_2\), i.e. only if they are equal. Hence $&tau;<sub>1</sub> &le; \(\tau_2\)
and \(\tau_2 \leq \tau_1\) only occurs when \(\tau_1 = \tau_2\)
</p>

<p>
Not a full ordering. Take two topologies on \(X = \{1, 2\}\), with
\(\tau_1 = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, X\}\) and
\(\tau_2 = \{\emptyset, \{2\}, X\}\).
Evidently \(\tau_1\) and \(\tau_2\) cannot be compared as \(\tau_1\) does not
include \(\{2\}\) and \(\tau_2\) does not include \(\{1\}\).
</p>

<p>
Minimal topology is \(\{\emptyset, X\}\). Maximal topology is the topology
where every subset of \(X\) is open.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Can two distinct topologies \(\tau_1\) and \(\tau_2\) in \(X\) generate the same
relative topology in a subset \(A \subseteq X\)?
</p>

<p>
Yes, if they have the same subsets of \(A\) in the topology but different
subsets of \(X - A\).
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Let \(X = \{a, b, c\}\), \(A = \{a, b\}\), \(B = \{b, c\}\) and
\(\mathscr{G} = \{\emptyset, X, A, B\}\). Is \(\mathscr{G}\) a base for a
topology in \(X\)?
</p>

<p>
No, since \(A \cap B = \{b\}\) is open but cannot be described as a union of
elements of the base.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove if \(M\) is an uncountable subset of a topological space with a
countable base, then some point of \(M\) is a limit point of \(M\).
</p>

<p>
Assume for contradiction that \(M\) doesn't have a limit point. Then for any
\(x\in M\) there exists some \(G_x\in\mathscr{G}\) such that \(G_x\cap M =
   \{x\}\). For another point \(y\in M\) we can also find
\(G_y \cap M = \{y\}\). Hence \(x \not= y \Rightarrow G_x \not= G_y\), which
defines an injection from \(M\) to \(\mathscr{G}\), so \(|M|\leq|\mathscr{G}|\).
Hence \(M\) is countable, but this is a contradiction. Therefore there must be
a limit point in \(M\).

Prove \(T\) in Example 4, from page 79, (where \(T = \{a, b\}\) and the open
sets are \(\emptyset\), \(T\), and \(\{b\}\)) is connected.
</p>

<p>
<i>Comment.</i> \(T\) might be called a ‘connected doubleton’.
</p>

<p>
\(\{b\}\) is not closed as \(T - \{b\} = \{a\}\) is not open. Hence \(\emptyset\)
and \(T\) are the only sets which are both open and closed, therefore \(T\) is
connected.

Prove a topological space satisfying the second axiom of countability
automatically satisfies the first axiom of countability.
</p>

<p>
If \(T\) satisfies the second axiom of countability, i.e. \(T\) has a countable
base \(\mathscr{G}\), then by Theorem 3, for any \(O_x \subseteq T\) containing
\(x\), there is a set \(G_\alpha \in \mathscr{G}\) such that
\(x \in G_\alpha \subseteq O_x\), i.e. the topology satisfies the
first axiom of countability.

<li><p><p>
Given an example of a topological space satisfying the first axiom but not
the second.
</p>

<p>
A discrete, uncountable topology satisfies the first axiom of countability,
but not the second axiom. In the discrete topology, every distinct point is
an open set, so it cannot be covered by a countable base.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Let \(\tau\) be the system of sets containing the empty set and every subset
of the closed unit interval \([0, 1]\) obtained by deleting a finite or
countable number of points from \(X\). Verify that \(T = (X, \tau)\) is a
topological space. Prove that \(T\) satisfies neither the second nor the
first axiom of countability. Prove \(T\) is a \(T_1\)​-space, but not a
Hausdorff space.
</p>

<p>
\(\emptyset\) in \(\tau\) and \(X\) in \(\tau\) for the cases where no points are
deleted. Need to show open sets are closed under arbitrary unions and
finite intersections.
</p>

<p>
Let \(G_\alpha\) be the open sets in &tau; and \(F_\alpha\) be the corresponding
closed sets. Then for any arbitrary index set \(I\),
\[
    \cup_\alpha G_\alpha =
    \cup_\alpha (X - F_\alpha) =
    X - \cap_\alpha F_\alpha.
    \]
Since closed sets are closed under arbitrary intersections, and
\(\cap_\alpha F_\alpha \subseteq F_\beta\) for some closed set which is at
most countable, the arbitrary union is \(X\) with a countable number of
points removed. So closed under arbitrary unions.
</p>

<p>
For finite \(k\), \(\cap_k G_k = \cap_k (X - F_k) = X - \cup F_k\). A finite
union of closed sets is closed, and a finite union of countable sets is
countable, hence the topology is closed under finite intersections.
</p>

<p>
By Problem 8, for the countability axioms, we simply need to show that the
space does not satisfy the first axiom of countability. Let \(G\) be an open
set of \(x\) where all of the rationals (except \(x\) if it is rational) have
been removed. Then there is only one open set
\(O\) such that \(x \in O \subseteq G\), namely, \(G\). So the first axiom is not
satisifed, and hence neither is the second.
</p>

<p>
Let \(x\) and \(y\) be two distinct points and
\(O_x = [0, y) \cup (y, 1]\) and \(O_y = [0, x) \cup (x, 1]\). Then
\(x \notin O_y\) and \(y \notin O_x\), hence \(T_1\)​-space.
</p>

<p>
Any open set including \(x\) will only have a countable set of \(X\) removed,
as will any open set including \(y\). Hence \(O_x \cap O_y \not= \emptyset\),
so not Hausdorff.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Let \(T\) be the same as in Problem 10. Prove that the only convegent
sequences in \(T\) are the ‘stationary sequences’, i.e. the sequences all of
whose terms are the same starting from some index \(n\). Prove that the set
\(M = (0, 1]\) has the point \(0\) as a contact point, but contains no sequence
of points converging to \(0\).
</p>

<p>
For contradiction, assume that there is a non-stationary sequence, i.e.
(without loss of generalisation) for all \(x_n\) in the sequence,
\(O_{x_{n+1}} \subseteq O_{x_{n}}\) and \(x_{n_1} \not= x_n\). However, this
defines a countable neighbourhood base of the limit point \(x\),
but the space does not satsify the first axiom of countability, so there is
a contradiction.
</p>

<p>
\(0\) is a contact point of \(M\), as for any open set \(O_0\) of \(0\)
\(O_0 \cap M \not= \emptyset\), remember (\(\{0\}\) is not an open set).
</p>

<p>
Since the only convergent sequences in \(T\) are ‘stationary sequences’,
no sequence of points in \(M = (0, 1]\) can converge to a point outside of
\(M\), so no sequence can converge to \(0\).
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove the converse of Theorem 8, i.e. prove if every finite subset of \(T\)
is closed, \(T\) is a \(T_1\)​-space.
</p>

<p>
<i>Comment.</i> Hence a topological space \(T\) is a \(T_1\)​-space iff every finite
subset of \(T\) is closed.
</p>

<p>
If every finite subset of \(T\) is closed, then for all \(x \in T\), \(\{x\}\) is
closed, i.e. \(T - \{x\}\) is open. Then for any two distinct points \(x\) and
\(y\), we can construct two neighbourhoods
\(x\) &isin; O<sub>x</sub> = T - \{y\}$ and \(y \in O_y = T - \{x\}\)
such that \(x \notin O_y\) and \(y \notin O_x\). Hence \(T\) is a \(T_1\)​-space.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove the following theorem, known as Urysohn’s lemma: given a normal space
\(T\) and two disjoint closed sets \(F_1, F_2 \in T\), there exists a
continuous real function \(f\) such that \(0 \leq f(x) \leq 1\) and
\[f(x) = \begin{cases}
    0 \textrm{ if } x \in F_1 \\
    1 \textrm{ if } x \in F_2.
    \end{cases}\]
</p>

<p>
\(f\) is a mapping from \(T\) to \([0, 1]\), which is a metric space and hence a
normal topological space (and also therefore a \(T_1\)​-space). The preimage
of \(\{0\}\), which is closed in \([0, 1]\) (by Theorem 8), is \(F_1\), which is
closed in \(T\), and the preimage of \(\{1\}\), which too is closed in \([0,
    1]\), is \(F_2\), which is closed in \(T\).
</p>

<p>
[TODO: Unclear what steps then need to be taken here&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
(Potentially&#x2026;) As \(T\) is normal, we can define \(f\) such that for any
closed \(F \in (0, 1)\), the preimage \(\Gamma = f^{-1}(F)\) is closed in \(T\).
Therefore \(f\) is continuous, by Theorem 10’.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, we have a remark saying that a mapping \(f\) of \(X\) into \(Y\)
is continuous if and only if the topology \(\tau_X\) is <i>stronger</i> than the
topology \(f^{-1}(\tau_Y)\) on page 86. Maybe this statement could be helpful.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
A \(T_1\)​-space \(T\) is said to be <i>completely regular</i> if, given any closed
set \(F \subseteq T\) and any point \(x_0 \in T - F\), there exists a
continuous real function \(f\) such that \(0 \leq f(x) \leq 1\) and
\[f(x) = \begin{cases}
    0 \textrm{ if } x = x_0 \\
    1 \textrm{ if } x \in F.
    \end{cases}\]
(Completely regular spaces are also called Tychonoff spaces.) Prove that
every normal space is completely regular, but not conversely. Prove that
every subspace of a completely regular space (in particular, of a normal
space) is completely regular.
