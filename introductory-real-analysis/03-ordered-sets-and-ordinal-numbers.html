<h1 class="title">Set Theory: Ordered Sets and Ordinal Numbers</h1>
<p>
Definitions of <i>partial ordering</i>, <i>partially ordered</i> (reflexive, transitive,
antisymmetric), <i>maximal</i>, <i>minimal</i>.
</p>

<p>
A bijective function \(f\) is <i>order-preserving</i> if \(a \leq b \Rightarrow f(a)
\leq f(b)\). An order-preserving function \(f\) is an isomorphism if \(f(a) \leq
f(b) \Leftrightarrow a \leq b\). Two partially ordered sets are <i>isomorphic</i> if
there exists an isomorphism between them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Noncomparable</i> if neither \(a \leq b\) nor \(b \leq a\). A set is <i>ordered</i> if it
contains no noncomparable elements. Two isomorphic sets have the same (<i>order</i>)
<i>type</i>. Order of \(\mathbb{N}\) (in the normal manner) is \(\omega\). The power
\(\aleph_0\) corresponds to the order type \(\omega\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition 1</b>
An ordered set \(M\) is <i>well-ordered</i> if every nonempty subset \(A\) of \(M\) has a
<i>smallest</i> (or “​<i>first</i>​”) <i>element</i>, i.e., an element \(\mu\) such that \(\mu \leq
a\) for every \(a \in A\).
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition 2</b>
The order type of a well-ordered set is an <i>ordinal number</i> or simply an
<i>ordinal</i>. If the set is infinite, the ordinal is <i>transfinite</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgb8bc28e">
<p>
The ordered sum of a finite number of well-ordered sets \(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_n\)
is itself a well-ordered set.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org84d5a74">
<p>
Let \(M\) be an arbitrary subset of the ordered sum \(M_1+M_2+\ldots+M_n\), and let
\(M_k\) be the first set containing elements of \(M\). Then \(M \cap M_k\) is a
subset of the well-ordered set \(M_k\), and therefore has a smallest element
\(\mu\). Clearly \(\mu\) is also the smallest element of \(M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
Need to check whether this holds for the sum of countably many well-ordered
sets, and why?
</p>

<p>
<b>Corollary</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org7a03828">
<p>
The ordered sum of a finite number of ordinal numbers is itself an ordinal
number.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgf8eb164">
<p>
The ordered product of two well-ordered sets \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) is well-ordered.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org105c6c7">
<p>
Let \(M\) be an arbitrary subset of \(M_1 \cdot M_2\), with \((a, b)\) such that \(a
\in M_1\), \(b \in M_2\). The set of all second elements \(b\) in \(M\) is a subset of
\(M_2\), and therefore has a least element \(b_1\) since \(M_2\) is well-ordered.
Then look at all \((a, b_1)\). Again, the set of all first elements \(a\) is a
subset of \(M_1\), hence has a smallest element \(a_1\) since \(M_1\) is
well-ordered. \((a_1, b_1)\) is clearly the smallest element of \(M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Corollary 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org91f91dc">
<p>
The ordered product of a finite number of well-ordered sets is itself a
well-ordered set.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Corollary 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org42da3c5">
<p>
The ordered product of a finite number of ordinal numbers is itself an ordinal
number.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Every element of a well-ordered set \(M\) determines an (<i>initial</i>) <i>section</i>
\(P\), the set of all \(x \in M\) such that \(x < a\), and a <i>remainder</i> \(Q\), the set
of all \(x \in M\) such that \(x \geq a\). Given two well-ordered sets \(M\) and \(N\)
of order type \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) respectively, then:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>\(\alpha = \beta\) if \(M\) and \(N\) are isomorphic.</p></li>
<li><p>\(\alpha < \beta\) if \(M\) is isomorphic to some section of \(N\).</p></li>
<li><p>\(\alpha > \beta\) if \(N\) is isomorphic to some section of \(M\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Lemma</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org7397892">
<p>
Let \(f\) be an isomorphism of a well-ordered set \(A\) onto some subset \(B
\subseteq A\). Then \(f(a) \geq a\) for all \(a \in A\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org1e4e8fb">
<p>
If there exists \(a \in A\) such that \(f(a) < a\), then there is a least such
element \(a_0\) since \(A\) is well-ordered. Let \(b_0 = f(a_0)\), then \(b_0 < a_0\),
and \(f(b_0) < f(a_0) = b_0\) since \(f\) is an isomorphism. But then \(a_0\) is not
the smallest element such that \(f(a) < a\). Contradiction.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 3</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org69e9eec">
<p>
Two given ordinal numbers \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) satisfy one and only one of the
relations \(\alpha < \beta\), \(\alpha = \beta\), \(\alpha > \beta\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orge1fc898">
<p>
Let \(W(\alpha)\) be the set of all ordinals \(<\alpha\). Any two numbers \(\gamma\)
and \(\gamma^{\prime}\) in \(W(\alpha)\) are comparable and the corresponding
ordering of \(W(\alpha)\) makes it a well-ordered set of type \(\alpha\). If a set
\(A\) is of type \(\alpha\), then by definition, the ordinals less than \(\alpha\)
are the types of well-ordered sets isomorphic to sections of \(A\). Hence, the
ordinals are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of \(A\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) be two ordinals, then \(W(\alpha)\), \(W(\beta)\) are
well-ordered sets of type \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) respectively. Let \(C = A \cap B\).
Then \(C\) is well-ordered, of type \(\gamma\), say. We now show \(\gamma \leq
\alpha\). If \(C = A\), then obviously \(\gamma = \alpha\). Otherwise, if \(C \neq
A\), then \(C\) is a section of \(A\) and hence \(\gamma < \alpha\).
</p>

<p>
[Let \(\xi \in C\), \(\eta \in A - C\). Then \(\xi\),  \(\eta\) are comparable, i.e.,
either \(\xi < \eta\) or \(\xi > \eta\). But \(\eta < \xi < \alpha\) is
impossible, since then \(\eta \in C\). Therefore \(\xi < \eta\) and hence \(C\) is a
section of \(A\), which implies \(\gamma < \alpha\). Moreover, \(\gamma\) is the
first element of \(A-C\).]
</p>

<p>
Thus \(\gamma \leq \alpha\). Similarly \(\gamma \leq \beta\). The case \(\gamma <
\alpha\), \(\gamma < \beta\) is impossible, since then \(\gamma \in A-C\), \(\gamma
\in B-C\). But then \(\gamma \notin C\) on the one hand and \(\gamma \in A \cap B =
C\) on the other hand.
</p>

<p>
It follows that there are only three possibilities:
</p>

<p>
\[\gamma = \alpha, \gamma = \beta, \alpha = \beta\]
\[\gamma = \alpha, \gamma < \beta, \alpha < \beta\]
\[\gamma < \alpha, \gamma = \beta, \alpha > \beta\]
</p>

<p>
i.e., \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are comparable.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 4</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org77ab56a">
<p>
Let \(A\) and \(B\) be well-ordered sets. Then either \(A\) is equivalent to \(B\) or
one of the sets is of greater power than the other, i.e., the powers of \(A\) and
\(B\) are comparable.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orga45e699">
<p>
A definite power corresponds to each ordinal. As ordinals are comparable, so
are the corresponding powers.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Well-ordering theorem</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgb22815f">
<p>
Every set can be well-ordered.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Axiom of choice</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org82b7a84">
<p>
Given any set \(M\), there is a “choice function” \(f\) such that \(f(A)\) is an
element of \(A\) for every nonempty subset \(A \subseteq M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Definition 3</b>
Let \(M\) be a partially ordered set, and let \(A\) be any subset of \(M\) such that
\(a\) and \(b\) are comparable for every \(a\), \(b \in A\). Then \(A\) is a <i>chain</i> (in
\(M\)). A chain \(C\) is <i>maximal</i> if there is no other chain \(C^{\prime}\) in \(M\)
containing \(C\) as a proper subset.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definiton 4</b>
An element \(a\) of a partially ordered set \(M\) is an <i>upper bound</i> of a subset
\(M^{\prime} \subseteq M\) if \(a^{\prime} \leq a\) for every \(a^{\prime} \in
M^{\prime}\).
</p>

<p>
The below two assertions are equivalent to the axiom of choice.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hausdorff’s maximal principle</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org28fb726">
<p>
Every chain in a partially ordered set \(M\) is contained in a maximal chain in
\(M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Zorn’s Lemma</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org3af6b27">
<p>
If every chain in a partially ordered set \(M\) has an upper bound, then \(M\)
contains a maximal element.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5</b> (Mathematical induction)
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org56db90e">
<p>
Given a proposition \(P(n)\) formulated fo every positive integer \(n\), suppose
that
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>\(P(1)\) is true.</p></li>
<li><p>The validity of \(P(k)\) for all \(k \leq n\) implies the validity of \(P(n+1)\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Then \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n = 1, 2, \ldots\)
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org8408b43">
<p>
Suppose \(P(n)\) fails to be true for all \(n = 1, 2, \ldots\) Let \(n_1\) be the
smallest integer for which \(P(n)\) is false (\(n_1\) exists due to the
well-ordering of the positive integers). Clearly \(n_1 > 1\), so \(n_1 - 1\) is a
positive integer. Therefore \(P(n)\) is valid for all \(k \leq n_1 -1\), but not
for \(n_1\). Contradiction.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5’</b> (Transfinite induction)
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org0967728">
<p>
Given a well-ordered set \(A\), let \(P(a)\) be a proposition formulated for every
element \(a \in A\). Suppose that

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>\(P(a)\) is true for the smallest element of \(A\).</p></li>
<li><p>The validity of \(P(a)\) for all \(a < a^*\) implies the validity of \(P(a^*)\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Then \(P(a)\) is true for all \(a \in A\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org388d640">
<p>
Suppose \(P(a)\) fails to be true for all \(a \in A\). Then \(P(a)\) is false for all
\(a\) in some nonempty subset \(A^* \subseteq A\). By well-ordering, \(A^*\) has a
smallest element \(a^*\). Therefore \(P(a)\) is valid for all \(a< a^*\) but not for
\(a^*\). Contradiction.

Exhibit both a partial ordering and a simple ordering of the set of all

What is the minimal element of the set of all subsets of a given set \(X\),
partially ordered by set inclusion? What is the maximal element?
</p>

<p>
\(\emptyset\) and \(X\).
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
A partially ordered set \(M\) is a <i>directed set</i> if, given any two element
\(a\), \(b \in M\), there is an element \(c \in M\) such that \(a \leq c\), \(b \leq
   c\). Are the partially ordered sets in Examples 1-4, Section 3.1 all directed
sets?
</p>

<p>
No, yes, yes, yes.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
The <i>greatest lower bound</i> of two elements \(a\) and \(b\) of a partially
ordered set \(M\) is \(c \in M\) such that \(c \leq a\), \(c \leq b\) and there is
no element \(d \in M\) such that \(c < d \leq a\), \(d \leq b\). Define
<i>least upper bound</i> similarly. A <i>lattice</i> is a partially ordered set with
both a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. Prove that the set of
all subsets of a given set \(X\), partially ordered by set inclusion, is a
lattice. What is the set-theoretic meaning of the greatest lower bound and
least upper bound of two elements of this set?

Same as 2.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that an order-preserving mapping of one ordered set onto another is
automatically an isomorphism.
</p>

<p>
All order-mapping preserving mappings are bijective. Hence an inverse
exists. Need to show how the inverse also preserves order. Hence
isomorphism.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that ordered sums and products of ordered sets are associative.
</p>

<p>
Just step through to show that they are the same.

Construct well-ordered sets with ordinals \(\omega + n\), … Show that the sets
are all countable.
</p>

<p>
\(\mathbb{N} + \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}\), …
Line each one up on a row, and zigzag up and down.

Construct well-ordered sets with ordinals \(\omega \cdot n\), … Show that the

\(\mathbb{N} \cdot \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}\), …
Similar proof to countability of the rationals.

<li><p><p>
Show that \(\omega + \omega = \omega \cdot 2\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(f\) send \(a \in \mathbb{N}_1 + \mathbb{N}_2\) to \((a, 1)\) if \(a \in
   \mathbb{N}_1\) and to \((a, 2)\) if \(a \in \mathbb{N}_2\). Evidently bijective,
and order-preserving, hence isomorphic, and hence they have equivalent
ordinals too.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that the set \(W(\alpha)\) of all ordinals less than a given ordinal
\(\alpha\) is well-ordered.
</p>

<p>
Each ordinal less than \(\alpha\) corresponds to a section of \(A\). There is a
least section of \(A\), the empty set, as all other sections of \(A\) are
greater than or equal to it. Hence the corresponding ordinal to the empty
set is the least element of \(W(\alpha)\) and we also know that ordinals are
comparable.  Therefore \(W(\alpha)\) is well-ordered.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that any nonempty set of ordinals is well-ordered.
</p>

<p>
\(A\) subset. Nonempty and ordinals are comparable so exists \(\mu \in A\) such
that \(\mu \leq a\) for all \(a \in A\). Therefore well-ordered.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that the set \(M\) of all ordinals corresponding to a countable set is
itself countable.
</p>

<p>
Line them up. Then use Cantor diagonal argument.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Let \(\aleph_1\) be the power of the set \(M\) in the preceding problem. Prove
that there is no power \(m\) such that \(\aleph_0 < m < \aleph_1\).
</p>

<p>
Impossible as there is no set which is strictly bigger than countable and
yet strictly smaller than uncountable.
