<h1 class="title">Set Theory: Equivalence of Sets. The Power of a Set</h1>
<p>
Definitions of finite, infinite, countable, uncountable. Demonstration of how
the rationals are countable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgba26cf9">
<p>
Every subset of a countable subset is countable.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 2</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="orgbd96cd7">
<p>
The union of a finite or countable number of countable sets is itself
countable.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgd7d1a64">
<p>
Line the elements of the sets parallel to each other, and count all of the
elements ‘diagonally’.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 3</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org7773d3a">
<p>
Every infinite set has a countable subset.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Definition of equivalence.
</p>

<p>
Demonstration of how the points on a sphere can be mapped one-to-one with the
points in the complex plane with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">stereographic projection</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 4</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org9f587a7">
<p>
Every infinite set \(M\) is equivalent to one of its proper subsets.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgfe55c81">
<p>
By Theorem 3, every infinite set contains a countable subset \(A\). Partition
this subset into two countable subsets \(A_1\) and \(A_2\). A one-to-one
correspondence can be set between \(A\) and \(A_1\). Hence \(M = A \cup (M - A)
\sim A_1 \cup (M - A) = M - A_2\) and \(M - A_2\) is a proper subset of \(M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org9155960">
<p>
The set of real numbers in the closed unit interval \([0, 1]\) is uncountable.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="org4b3b454">
<p>
Cantor’s diagonal. Make sure to disallow setting a digit as \(0\) or \(9\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
Definition of power, aleph null, continuum.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 6</b>
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org8e4e43d">
<p>
Given any set \(M\), let \(\mathcal{M}\) be the set whose elements are all possible
subsets of \(M\). Then the power of \(\mathcal{M}\) is greater than the power of
the original set \(M\).
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orge4f60bd">
<p>
Attempt to setup \(X\) to be the set of elements of \(M\) which do not belong to
their ‘associated subsets’. Then we reach an argument similar to Russel’s
paradox.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 7</b> (Cantor-Bernstein)
</p>
<div class="theorem" id="org9e883d2">
<p>
Given any two sets \(A\) and \(B\), suppose \(A\) contains a subset \(A_1\) equivalent
to \(B\), while \(B\) contains a subset \(B_1\) equivalent to \(A\). Then \(A\) and \(B\)
are equivalent.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<i>Proof</i>
</p>
<div class="proof" id="orgae95e67">
<p>
The proof is beautifully shown in the book. A sketch would be a disservice.

<h2 id="equivalence-of-sets-the-power-of-a-set-problems">Problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-equivalence-of-sets-the-power-of-a-set-problems">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p><p>
Prove that a set with an uncountable subset is itself uncountable.
</p>

<p>
Suppose the set is countable, and very quickly reach a contradiction.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Let \(M\) be any infinite set and \(A\) any countable set. Prove that \(M \sim M
   \cup A\).
</p>

<p>
Use Theorem 3.
</p></p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the following sets are countable:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p><p>
The set of all numbers with two distinct decimal expansions.
</p>

<p>
Since all of the numbers can either be shown as \(n.x00000\) or \(n.y99999\),
only consider the \(n.x00000\) representation. Evident that this is a
subset of the rationals, hence countable.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
The set of all rational points in the plane.
</p>

<p>
Simply extend the technique used for demonstrating that the rationals are
countable.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
The set of all rational intervals.
</p>

<p>
This can be transposed to be a subset of the the set of all rational
points in the plane, i.e. the previous question.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
The set of all polynomials with rational coefficients.
</p>

<p>
This can be transposed to a subset of the set of all rational points in
\(n\) dimensions. Extend the argument for problem 3.2. from 2 dimensions to
\(n\) dimensions.
</p></p></li>
</ol></p></li>
<li><p><p>
A number \(\alpha\) is called <i>algebraic</i> if it is a root of a polynomial
equation with rational coefficients. Prove that the set of all algebraic
numbers is countable.
</p>

<p>
The set of all polynomials with rational coefficients is countable, and each
polynomial has a maximum of \(n\) solutions. Hence countable by Theorem 2.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that the existence of uncountably many <i>transcendental</i> numbers, i.e.,
numbers which are not algebraic.
</p>

<p>
From Theorem 5, we know that there are uncountably many numbers between \([0,
   1]\). And from Theorem 2, we know that no union of countable sets will ever
become uncountable. Hence there must exist numbers within \([0, 1]\) which are
not algebraic. We call these <i>transcendental</i>.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that the set of all real functions (more generally, functions taking
values in a set containing at least two elements) defined on a set \(M\) is of
power greater than the power of \(M\). In particular, prove that the power of
the set of <i>all</i> real functions (continuous and discontinuous) defined in
the interval \([0, 1]\) is greater than \(c\).
</p>

<p>
Just look at the identity functions. The set of all identities has a
one-to-one correspondence with the power set.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Give an indirect proof of the equivalence of the closed interval \([a, b]\),
the open interval \((a, b)\) and the half-open interval \([a, b)\) or \((a, b]\).
</p>

<p>
Need to find suitable functions to use with Theorem 7.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Prove that the union of a finite or countable number of sets each of power
\(c\) is itself of power \(c\).
</p>

<p>
Since \([0, 1]\) is uncountable, and by problem 7, so is \([0, 1)\), map each
set to \([0, 1)\), \([1, 2)\), … respectively. Evidently the union is a subset
within the real line, and is itself of power \(c\).
</p></p></li>
<li><p>Prove that each of the following sets has the power of the continuum:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p><p>
The set of all infinite sequences of positive integers.
</p>

<p>
Place \( 0. \) in front of the integers to get the set \((0, 1)\).
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
The set of all ordered \(n\)​-tuples of real numbers.
</p>

<p>
Use a similar argument to problem 8.
</p></p></li>
<li><p><p>
The set of all infinite sequences of real numbers.
</p>

<p>
Need to check how to deal with the uncountable sequences of real numbers.
</p></p></li>
</ol></p></li>
<li><p><p>
Develop a contradiction inherent in the notion of the “set of all sets
which are not members of themselves”.
</p>

<p>
Russell's paradox.
