<h2>Resident Advisor data analysis</h2>
<em>This article is still under development.</em>
<h3>What is data science?</h3>
<p>
Data science is a term which attempts to frame the dull administration of, fun play with and teeth-gnashing frustration with data as a respectable, profession-worthy science. Due to such willful obfuscation, data science may appear to be even more opaque than dark matter. This project strives to shine some light on what data science actually is.

Data can be found in abundance anywhere you can cast your eye. Where there is measurement, there is data. Naturally, those fascinated by measurement are the most likely to be fascinated by data. Many data science projects and articles busy themselves with topics such as finance, economics and the natural sciences, where any insights can be weaponised in the race to make money, make more money or receive the next batch of funding. Insanely geeky fields also receive a lot of attention: One of the most popular datasets available on Kaggle, an online gathering place for data scientists, is called <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon">Pokemon with stats</a>. The only other field with considerable literature approachable for the everyday non-data-crazy layperson is the world's favourite past-time, sport. Of course, any insights into sport can be weaponised against the bookies in the race to lose less money.

<h3>Why underground electronic music?</h3>

"Open Eye Signal" by Jon Hopkins from the album <a href="http://smarturl.it/ImmunityJH">Immunity</a> astounded me when I first heard it. The whole album revealed a whole new uncharted musical territory to me. As I explored the scene more, I became ever more enamoured with underground electronic music and its surrounding culture. A culture I am rabid about. A perfect topic for a project.

<a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net">Resident Advisor</a> is the core online hub for underground electronic music fans. RA acts as an online magazine (with news, reviews and features), ticket seller and event information centre. Few subcultures have such a comprehensive - and universally admired - central platform. Hence, the data available on RA are, rather uniquely, complete and clean. A data scientist's dream.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Obtain data - scraping data from RA</h3>

<p>
<b>Task:</b> Find the top thousand DJs, and download the event information for every event they have ever played.
<br>
<b>Tools:</b> <a href=-"https://www.python.org">Python</a> for programming, <a href="https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests</a> for web scraping, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html">sqlite3</a> for storage, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">re</a> for string manipulation.
</p>

<p>
First of all, we have to import all of our tools.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="python">import requests
import re
import sqlite3
