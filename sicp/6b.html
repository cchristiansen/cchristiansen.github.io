On-demand computation is built into streams. Let's recap.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (nth-stream n s)
  (if (= n 0)
      (head s)
      (nth-stream (-1+ n) (tail s))))

(define (print-stream s)
  (cond ((empty-stream? s) "done")
        (else (print (head s))
              (print-stream (tail s)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A stream can be infinitely long.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (integers-from n)
  (cons-stream
   n
   (integers-from (+1 n))))
(define integers (integers-from 1))

(define (no-seven x)
  (not (= (remainder x 7) 0)))
(define ns (filter no-seven
                   integers))

We saw Hero of Alexandria's method for calculating square roots in lecture <a href="./1a.html">1a</a>.
Eratosthenes was a fellow Alexandrian, who created a method for calculating
primes.

  (cons-stream
   (head s)
   (sieve (filter
           (lambda (x)

           (tail s)))))
(define primes
  (sieve (integers-from 2)))

<code>sieve</code> is an infinitely recursive filter.

Procedures may process streams in one go. Take a look at two handy procedures.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (add-streams s1 s2)
  (cond ((empty-stream? s1) s2)
        ((empty-stream? s2) s1)
        (else
         (cons-stream
          (+ (head s1) (head s2))
          (add-streams (tail s1)
                       (tail s2))))))

(define (scale-stream c s)
  (map-stream (lambda (x) (* x c)) s))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using these two procedures, we can create procedures that process streams all
at once.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define integers
  (cons-stream 1
               (add-stream integers ones)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This looks an awful lot like a finite state accumulator. We can use the same
trick for integrals.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (integral s initial-value dt)
  (define int
    (cons-stream
     initial-value
     (add-streams (scale-stream dt s)
                  int)))
  int)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And also for Fibonacci numbers.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define fibs
  (cons-stream 0
     (cons-stream 1
        (add-streams fibs (tail fibs)))))
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
As we have recursive procedures, it's natural we have recursive data too. We
can still run into recursive problems however.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define y
  (integral
   dy 1 .001))
(define dy
  (map square y))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This doesn't work due to the recursive definition. There is a solution however.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (integral delayed-s
                  initial-value
                  dt)
  (define int
    (cons-stream
     initial-value
     (let ((s (force delayed-s)))
       (add-streams (scale-stream dt s)
                    int))))
  int)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Change the <code>integral</code> procedure to expect integrand to be a delayed object.
Then just need one more minor change.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define y
  (integral
   (delay dy) 1 0.001))
</pre>

<p>
The divorce of time in programs from time in computers has yielded powerful
methods of decomposition, all of which have remained hidden within
streams until now. By taking full advantage of this new method, we have started
to pull out the innards of streams, explicitly calling <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>.
</p>

<p>
Spaghetti code can be avoided, by changing the language so that all procedures
act like <code>cons-stream</code>. In <i>normal-order evaluation</i> languages (in constrast to
<i>applicative-order evaluation</i> languages), every procedure has an implicit
delay around its arguments. Streams wouldn't be needed, since lists would be
streams already. Miranda, by David Turner from the University of
Kent, is a normal-order evaluation language.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a price.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We're trying to think about programming as a way to specify processes. And if
we give up too much time, our language becomes more elegant, but it becomes a
little bit less expressive. There are certain distinctions that we can't draw.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the disadvantages is that we can't really express iteration.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (fact-iter a)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (&gt; counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With normal-order evaluation, the above code would run nowhere near as
efficiently. The <i>dragging tail problem</i> is an issue people writing operating
systems are faced with.
</p>

<p>
A more striking issue is that normal-order evaluation and side effects just
don't mix. It's impossible to model objects with local state and change, and at
the same time conjure normal-order tricks of decoupling time.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define x 0)
(define (id n)
  (set! x n)
  n)
(define (inc a) (1+ a))
(define y (inc (id 3)))
x
0
y
4
x
3
</pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>
The whole idea of putting in delays is that you throw away time. But when we
talk about state and set and change, that's exactly what we do want control of.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A so-called purely functional language has no side effects. The price is
losing assignment.
</p>

<p>
Let's take an example which would be naturally thought of in terms of object,
and approach it with a functional frame of mind.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(define (make-deposit-account
         balance deposit-stream)
  (cons-stream
   balance
   (make-deposit-account
    (+ balance (head deposit-stream))
    (tail deposit-stream))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We don't know if we can do everything without assignment, but there seem to be
places where functional programming breaks down. Where it starts hurting is
with objects and sharing and two independent agents being the same.
</p>

<p>
Say if we were to extend the bank account so that two users shared the same
account. The streams could be merged. <i>Fair merge</i> would alternately switch
between each user, and if one is empty at any point, take from the other stream
twice. However notice that we can't even explain the situation without talking
about time.
</p>

<p>
Note: it may be that with fair merge, assignment can be effectively simulated.
