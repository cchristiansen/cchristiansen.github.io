By now, pattern-matching syntax should be second nature to us.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(a ?x c)
(job ?x (computer ?y))
(job ?x (computer . ?y))
(a ?x ?x)
(?x ?y ?y ?x)
(a . ?x)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>match</code> asks the question: is there any way to match a pattern with data,
subject to bindings already in a dictionary?
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(match pat data dictionary)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The matcher was already covered in the lecture on systems with rule-based
control, so we'll skip it here.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-implementation-of-means-of-combination" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="implementation-of-means-of-combination"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Implementation of means of combination</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-implementation-of-means-of-combination">

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="./8b-or.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>

<p>
We have <i>closure</i>. The means of combination have the same overall structure as
the primitive things that we're combining.

How do we implement a rule? Here's a quick recap of a rule.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(rule (boss ?z ?d)
      (and (job ?x (?d . ?y))
           (supervisor ?x?z)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We match the conclusion of the rule against something we want to check is true.
That match gives us a dictionary, and with respect to the dictionary, we
process the body of the rule.
</p>

<p>
Actually, this is not quite true.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(boss ?who computer)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here we aren't matching a pattern against data, we are matching two patterns
and asking if they are consistent. A pattern matcher does not suffice; we
require a <i>unifier</i>, a slight generalisation of a pattern matcher. A unifier
takes two patterns and finds the most general thing that can be substituted for
the variables in those two patterns to satisfy both simultaneously.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">unify (?x ?x)
with ((a ?y z) (a b ?z))
results:
?x : (a b c)
?y : b
?z : c
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A more complicated example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">unify (?x ?x)
with ((?y a ?w) (b ?v ?z))
results:
?y : b
?v : a
?w : ?z
?x : (b a ?w)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Nothing clever is happening here. Just recursion.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">unify (?x ?x)
with (?y (a . ?y))
should result in:
?x : ?y
?y : (a a a ...)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>y</code> must be an infinite list of <code>a</code>'s. The logic program can't handle this.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-apply" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="apply"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Apply</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-apply">
<p>
<b>To apply a rule</b> <br />
Evaluate the rule body relative to an environment formed by unifying the rule
conclusion with the given query.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to applying a procedure.
</p>

<p>
<b>To apply a procedure</b> <br />
Evaluate the procedure body relative to an environment formed by binding the
procedure parameters to the argument.
</p>

<p>
We see the eval apply loop yet again.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-naming-conflicts" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="naming-conflicts"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Naming conflicts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-naming-conflicts">
<p>
To avoid name conflicts, we use the environment model. A more brutal (and
inefficient) method is also possible: every time a rule is applied, rename all
of the variables in the rule to some new unique names that won't conflict with
anything else.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-not" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="not"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Not</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not">
<p>
<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, and the logical implication of rules are not quite as they
seem.
</p>

<p>
In logic <code>(and p q)</code> and <code>(and q p)</code> are equivalent statements. This is not the
case in our language.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(rule (outranked-by ?s ?B)
      (or (supervisor ?s ?b)
          (and (supervisor ?s ?m)
               (outranked-by ?m ?b))))
(rule (outranked-by ?s ?B)
      (or (supervisor ?s ?b)
          (and (outranked-by ?m ?b)
               (supervisor ?s ?m))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The first statement functions as expected; the second leads to an infinite
loop. Changing <code>and</code>​s and <code>or</code>​s in logic programming can drastically change
the speed of the queries.
</p>

<p>
All humans are mortal.<br />
All Greeks are humans.<br />
Socrates is a Greek.<br />
∴ Socrates is a Greek.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(Greek Socrates)
(Greek Plato)
(Greek Zeus)
(god Zeus)
(rule (mortal ?x) (human ?x))
(rule (fallible ?x) (human ?x))
(rule (human ?x)
      (and (Greek ?x) (not (god ?x))))
(rule (address ?x Olympus)
      (and (Greek ?x) (god ?x)))
(rule (perfect ?x)
      (and (not (mortal ?x))
           (not (fallible ?x))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ask for the address of all perfect beings.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(and (address ?x ?y)
     (perfect ?x))
results:
Olympus

(and (perfect ?x)
     (address ?x ?y))
results:
nothing
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So is it Mount Olympus, or nothing? How do we know that Zeus is not mortal, and
not fallible? This is not defined anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<code>not</code> does not mean the logical not. <code>not</code> means not deducible: there no such
thing in the database, as opposed to not true. This is called the <i>closed
world assumption</i>. Under this assumption, all kinds of issues turn up, such as
<code>not not x</code> not being equal to <code>x</code>. <i>Closed world assumption</i> is dangerous for
real reasoning problems, marking a chasm between declarative and imperative
knowledge.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you start building up real reasoning programs based on this, think how
dangerous that is. You're saying: "I know I'm in a position to deduce
everything true that's relevant to this problem. I'm reasoning, and built into
my reasoning mechanism is the assumption that anything that I don't know can't
possible be relevant to this problem, right?" There are a lot of big
organisations that work like that. Most corporate marketing divisions work like
that.
